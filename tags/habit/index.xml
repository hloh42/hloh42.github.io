As a budding writer writing with the amount of time that I have to properly structure the workload I am given and have to learn each day , it seems hard to even hold on to this writing habit to even progress.</description></item><item><title>6th Dec 2025 -Entry- Getting Better</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/6th-dec-2025-entry-getting-better/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 22:36:41 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/6th-dec-2025-entry-getting-better/</guid><description>Getting Better
Tracking my progress over time , I can tell that I am getting better and not deluding myself , but the growth is more rewarding than I first assumed and slower than I thought.
I can focus now easily for at least 5 hrs attending to key tasks everyday that makes me work and my work ethic and discipline is getting better.

All it takes of me , is the effort of a tremendeous struggle , but a choice made not in heat but one of committed deed. To choose to write when uninspired , when all within is calling me to retire.
