Making progress but not enough , not deep enough to make a dent in the amount of expertise to be counted as good enough. Writing just because I have decided and made a point to write even when my thoughts are not gathered and this is my way of outputting even when my mind is racing and disorganized , making progress in my godot project.</description></item><item><title>1st Dec 2025 Entry - Writing Out Loud</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/1st-dec-2025-entry-writing-out-loud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 18:56:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/1st-dec-2025-entry-writing-out-loud/</guid><description>This is my 10th post for chaining my writing behavior.
