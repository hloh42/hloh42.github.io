The last few days I have been spending more time understanding html , css and Hugo rather than working on my writing.
It feels hard to concentrate and carry on your daily tasks if you know something is broken and it needs to be fixed and you are not quite up to knowledge or task yet to fix the issue.

Today&amp;rsquo;s focus is on just leveraging on a single thing and doing that one thing well. Actually doing well for a certain skill requires you to operate wholeheartedly to support that single goal.
A simple goal may be to write every day like what I am trying to do right now, depending on the depth of skill required.

To be accepting of who I am and yet be seeking to be more. What a oxymoron it feels to be human and yet it feels like to be human is to be like this all the time.
To monitor one&amp;rsquo;s growth and thoughts over the time and effort it takes to transform, it is a really humbling path to be taking day-in and day-out.</description></item></channel></rss>
