# 13th May 2025
The purpose of this writing is for me to practice writing down my thoughts and expressing myself as clear as possible through writing. My experiences and growth as a 42 Singapore Core , to recount and to remember the efforts I have given to myself.

My resolve to transform. Transmuted to words.

I just feel a strange calm.
More relaxed and less concerned.
I am surprised by how well everything is going.


Today , I have managed to overcome the curse of tiredness that I used to feel when I encounter "too much" new information and am compelled to use it on the spot.
I don't get the mechanism but I know sometimes it can be overcome. I am able to focus , though not at max capacity for 8hrs ++ but it's good enough for learning and today even after pushing and learning new material , I am not even cognitively tired at 8pm , 1st time ever. 

I feel like this is a good omen for things to come.

Hopefully I will be able to get a part-time job and settle my financial woes for a bit and growing at my own pace.
