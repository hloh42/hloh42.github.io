><span style="font-size:1.5em;"></span>

The 4 basic steps into solving problems according to Polya George 

1. Understanding the problem -  What is the unknown?
What are the data?
What is the condition?
Is it possible to satisfy the condition ?
Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown? 
Or is it insufficient ? Or redundant? Or Contradictory?

My own way to think about this is the preconditions of the problem and the algorithm we are trying to apply to solve the solution (as I am learning about the data structs right now.

It is a structured way to organize your thoughts about the problem and ground yourself in the right direction when trying to solve.

2. Devising a plan

3. Carrying out the plan (Nuance required here)

4. Looking back

In 1 book and 122 pages , what is given is a algorithm a recipe for how to better frame and solve problems for good.

Suggestion of a conduct which comes naturally to any persons who is seriously concerned with his problem and has some common sense. But the person who behaves the right way usually does not care to express his behavior in clear words and possibly he cannot express it so; the list tries to express it so.

The 4 steps given :
Understanding the problem , Devising a plan , Carrying out the plan , Looking back , sounds simple in theory and concept but there is a lot of nuance in the learning strategies applied and how to process and thinking about problems accurately so as to reduce the amount of noise to signal ratio to allow yourself to have the best chance of succeeding.

Imitation and practice  , the two items needed to make practical skill progression.

Given are many powerful questions , aimed at the teacher attempting to help stufents.
Especially questions meant to help achieve the right clarity and curiosity needed to develop to pique the fire to solve the problem.

Mental models / Checklist given so that one can easily solve problems readily / generally.

/*And for me I think about how a problem is formed in the 1st place , it is mostly formed due to your desires for some outcome. This might be a very buddhist approach as relating to your attachments to your problems but I can't help but thinking and see it in this way. If you didn't desire for more , for change , for a better outcome than you have right now. You would be able to be content and be able to live in your ideal present right now.*/
