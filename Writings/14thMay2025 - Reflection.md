### <u>Ft_split Refactoring</u>

Intention is to inform the reader.

I've finished libft project , although it is without testing.For my current pace.

 I think it's good, I am still able to take my own time at this rate. I am starting to plan and get ahead of the curriculum at my own pace . 

The biggest obstacle I was facing was against the norminette : [NORM] (https://github.com/42school/norminette).
It required me to express creativity to fit within the boundaries of clean code.
