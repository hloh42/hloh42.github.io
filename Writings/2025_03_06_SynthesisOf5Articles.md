The most impression that has been left on my memory is the interactive comic about memory , making my own flashcards about my learning desire and sumaary because  [^1] has been very well received in terms of what their outcome and impression on the reader is and has been. 

There are quite a few things I still remember and taken note from the comic/interactive media I have remembered . 

Ones like the 1st memory experiment scientist : Ebbinghaus Herman.

>Time + Testing = spaced repetition. And that your spacing repetition wil fail if your cards feel bloated , disconnected or meaningless.

>Remembering works best with increasing gaps when you are just about to forget about.

>The best type of memory to encode is when it is small , connected and meaningful.

>The best type of learning encoding to engage in is learning in the service of doing something you care about to get involved in the loop of trying to do something , getting stuck , looking up and learning something and continuing this process until you succeed in the aims of your vision while keeping it lean and approachable , sustainable.

The [^2] article about tacit knowledge really opened me up in terms of concept because it is something I have thought about but have not tried to express in words or thoughts or writing , I agree with the premise of the intangibles but however I do not quite agree with the conclusion that tacit knowledge is just "magic" and the only way is to absorb through going through the motions until magically you embody it as well , that sounds as dumb as transmissionisble.  Magic is sort of like mastery , when done 1 step at a time , you think that's something really easy but overtime when momentum and speed starts to overtake , and your basics no longer seem like the same fundamental move in the beginning , when people start calling your failures as successes , your efforts as valiant.. It is the same kind of view that I view tacit knowledge viewed by the author in a sense , because he/she understanding is not enough of the whole to see it through , like a doctor naming all chronic knee pain as Patellofemoral (puh-tel-o-FEM-uh-rul) pain syndrome.

[^3] has been skipped today due to it's length is equivalent to 5 articles I have read today , decided to postpone it for the sake of cognitive load management for myself as I still have critical tasks to do today. 

[^4]  is straightforward and will take awhile to implement ,  and is excellent for people without parenting skills and low-self esteem to slowly build up an evidence bank and also good for you to point to whenever you are feeling down and just gain confidence as you meditate on your current efforts.

[^5] in Singapore , we have a saying when you can't convince, confuse them! And it is the main message of the article, that probably it stems from inconfidence or fear that authors use complex pharsing or words to convey their meaning instead of using simple words with as low as friction as possible for everyone to understand their position and arguments so as to be evaluated on their ideas standing, instead opting to infuse complexity to obfuscate just like what I am doing in this last statement.

Today , I feel satisfied reading and learning and learning how to output my learning as I read and learn and express my learning into a simple to understand format for others to comprehend and share with.
