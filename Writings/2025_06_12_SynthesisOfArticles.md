Reading and writing , Input and output , taking what you have and turning it into skills and values that you embody. It is all a part of the learning process and at most times you take 3 steps forward , 2 steps backwards and then 1 step forwards all in the same day and are frustrated with your lack of progress even though you have been placing a lot of effort in your endeavor towards the goal you see and covert.

It is during the journey that you are changed as you take apart the resources that the older version of you created to survive and thrive in a different era of your life. During this journey you may lose track of yourself and your goals as you are just trying to survive to get to another day. As you forget the good intentions and projects set almost a whole cycle before. And that is the what [^3] is trying to show.

Incomplete rambling from a person who is still struggling to find his voice and authenticity is what I sense from this [^1] attempt as the author uses a lot of confusing terminology to say really little seems to be his general audience style. Only his series on tacile knowledge after going into nuances , that I found it a bit interesting.So I know the author is capable of conveying triad of depth , nuance and practicability.[^2]

Wrapping it all up today ,  Don't let the sparkle fool you for the actual thing , listen and observe for belivability and always assess independently for each piece of writing instead of basing it on the branding of the person.
