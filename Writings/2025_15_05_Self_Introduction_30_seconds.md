Writing a good self-introduction seems daunting . You only got one chance after all whether from your appearance , writing , products , work to show the best side of yourself before people decide you are someone that they want to associate with.

> To me ,  I feel like I still haven't the essence of who I am and what I am all about , even though I have a myraid number of interests. 
> My deepest skill so far seems to be programming

><span style="font-size:3em;">Failing upstream is the direction where I want to go , and I don't want to be limited by my own lack of imagination.</span>

What I offer on this blog is my marketing views , writing skills , thinking frameworks and understanding knowledge chunks to help consolidate my learnings and build meaningful projects to pull myself forward towards the direction of my life.

2025's theme is > Renewal

And the planned scope is mostly on building a even stronger programming foundation for all of my other life projects to leverage upon and scale up. 

I will be exploring web-blog deployment and automation deployment using hugo and n8n respectively.

I hope my writings will surf you the reader some musings along your journey.
