><span style="font-size:2.5em;">Where the true game resides</span>

Hook :  The game within the game is the true game yet it is unnamed until you have the underlying fundamentals yet there are infinite levels to this game.

The meta game of understanding the underlying essence of a principle also knowing as hacking in many circles. It is only accessible to people who have cleared the fundamentals and are playing on a different level of shell(cmd)  /  frame of mind and I think this level of game just keeps going up because it is unlimited in scope , complexity and variables . 

To simplify what I mean it is to there are as many games as there are people. Because each viewpoint is playing a different meaning and purpose in this arrangement of time and coincidents or causes with reason with which we are lacking the fidelity to view the complexity at work yet though we can easily feel and experiment the changes immediately with the felt experience.

The practical impliation of this realization is that you really cannot compare to others for any reason at all. It means no worries, and really the only person you should realistically compare is yourself.
And the guiding principle is to give calm to comparing youtself to others who have different capabilities and are capable of different speeds.

Different realities , all at once in a similar space. Able to interact and help with each other and yet distinctively different.

Same same but different
