The argument for rational authority and irrational authority which uses fear and other manipulation methods to ensure that others do not raise and challenge. 

Rational Authority which relies on competency and higher level of skills and expertise , it is just easier to respect someone who rightfully earned the right to extend their authority because of their developed expertise . But times are changing and expertise is demanded from the get-go and teams are lead by incompetence and tomfoolery to bamboozle the people under them to give more than than have to dangling a little carrot that if they were to do just a bit more , they too would be able to get the benefits..but the people are getting wise to such empty promises. In reality right now 2025 AD , we are expected to work for leaders with irrational authority for long hours and low pay, and it just feels not worth it to work because they are not going to train you , are trying to milk you and have no qualms about blaming you when something goes wrong , because that is the character of the leaders we have in these bureaucratic institutions who are making the decisions nowadays. It is a sorry state of affairs but many people have adapted by lying and I just don't see how 2 wrongs make a right.I think my personal adaption to such a state of affairs is to be strong alone and wait for the storm to wash out the trash.

Because power does not stem from ill-formed structures , no matter the intention , era  or will wishing.Power needs action and integrity in order to form its strength, I rather align with the truth and wait out the storm, building myself up until the time comes.

Until the the day comes.

Irrational Authority to simplify it is just entitled or lazy people trying to take power when they have not done the work and when situations arises , they are just not able to deal with the situation , and each time a crisis hits , most likely someone would be scapegoated and the organization continues chugging along. Really wished 2008 crash and
