After the 1st challenge and while creating test cases and waiting for an evaluation  , I am reading the ft_printf assignment and breaking it down. This is my 3rd layer of learning for this partciular assignment today. 

The 1st layer of learning I had was of reading here :  https://42-cursus.gitbook.io/guide/1-rank-01/ft_printf/building-the-thing
The 2nd layer of learning I did was from the  Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie C Programming book : Recreated the min_printf from the book to fit requirements of ft_printf and linking libft.a from the 1st project into vscode. 
Another layer I was learning from was peers, I would call it 2.5D learning , I was listening to a peer evaluation of their project of ft_printf codes and how they managed to capture and extract the user requirements of the man and how they handled the flags and different flags and know that the bonus was going to be a lot more effort compared to the base version to implement. But I had decided to do it anyways as my main motivation was to improve my fundamentals as a programmer and not be afraid of hard work.
Now today , I am working on my 3rd layer of study , implementing the base version first of cspdiuxX% before thinking about the bonus.
