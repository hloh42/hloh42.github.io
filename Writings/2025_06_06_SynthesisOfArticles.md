><span style="font-size:2.5em;">Summarization of Articles</span>

><span style="font-size:1.5em;">as recommeded by my own interest</span>

[^1] This article is harder to extrapolate value from for me, as I find it lower in value as it is part of my comfort zone. Reading it on the surface , it is talking about the ubquitity of schedules and having lived an entire lifetime conforming to them.Especially in a socially conforming state like Japan. What you should be doing at this age at this time at this hour for your progression of your already planned out life just sounds like a longly meted out death sentence , awaiting for you to progress onto that day and it to me sounds like hell. However to this author , schedules are structures. Irrational structures putting you on the same normal pages as everyone . 

When you do not conform , others wonder and ask whether you are a student?
The double standards and expectations of schedules create a duality in problem and solutions.
Others do not share the same schedule but as a business owner and highly skilled one, using his one hour , he is able to solve a thousand hours of problems for his users of another time zone. 

More than the leverage of skills and freedom and how conventionally tied the usual work person is whether blue or white collared , their vision is tied to the culture and their imagination and from their questions and expectations, it seems to me they all are dull in comparison and they are expecting you to commiserate in this condition.

I'm not even sure this is the main point about the article but this is what I got from it because this is the level I am reading into this article in order to extract value for myself , otherwise it would be too boring.

[^2] This is just a short tweet like post talking about the sublime influences that reading is meant to expand your mind and can make you a reminder to be mindful of the content you consume and not to be mindless when having a content diet on social media.

Reminder : [^2]
[^3] Inversion principle from Farnam Street blog which I have read upon , the author  ANUP Jadhav made it part of his output and made it practical in his own words. This mental model based on the maxim - invert, always inert. 

Considers an inverse outcome and listing the reasons for these.
Forces you to either stop doing certain activities or avoid the actions that will lead to the negatuve outcomes.
It provides with clarity that action x leads to y outcome definitely.

The algorithm for inversion : 
1. Define the problem - What is it that you're trying to achieve?
2. Invert it - What would gurantee the failure to achieve this outcome?
3. Consider solutions to avoid this failure.

His examples seem kinda of weak although relatable.

Listed below 1 of his examples : 
Instead of asking how do we increase the adoption of a product or feature? You could instead consider - what are some of things preventing adoption? This would lead to a list like this that you could potentially fix:

    Slow load time i.e. performance issues
    Not enough marketing, or marketing on the platform, or to the wrong audience
    The user guide instructions are not clear ... you get the idea

Here is a better article that I found after searching for a better description for inversion : 
https://jamesclear.com/inversion

And In my own words after reading through: 
Lets invert the following problem for better sleep :
What are the mistakes I can avoid to sleep earlier 
List generated by AI , selected top 3 most committed by me.
1. Drinking Too Much Water Before Bed
Excessive fluid intake in the evening can lead to frequent trips to the bathroom, disrupting your sleep
2. Overthinking or Stressing in Bed
Worrying about the next day or dwelling on problems can keep your mind active and delay sleep onset. Practice relaxation techniques to calm your mind
3. Inconsistent Sleep Schedule
Going to bed and waking up at different times each day confuses your body’s internal clock and makes it harder to fall asleep early. Stick to a regular schedule

1. Drinking Too Much Water Before Bed
Inversion:
Limit fluid intake in the hour or two before bedtime.
Hydrate well earlier in the day so you’re not thirsty at night.
Make your last drink a small one if you need it before bed.

2. Overthinking or Stressing in Bed
Inversion:
Establish a relaxing wind-down routine before bed (e.g., reading, meditation, gentle stretching, or listening to calming music)
Practice mindfulness or deep breathing exercises to calm your mind.
Write down worries or to-do lists earlier in the evening to clear your mind before sleep.

3. Inconsistent Sleep Schedule
Inversion:

Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends
Set reminders or alarms to help you stick to your schedule
Prioritize sleep by making it a non-negotiable part of your daily routine
Keep your wind-down routine consistent each night to cue your body for sleep

May you invert , always invert and solve your problems with more clarity [^3]

[^4] The core of Andrea Kuszewski's article is about developing fluid intelligence that even autistic and underdeveloped kids that everyone can replicate to get similar results to get the good word out.

Her definition of intelligence which I think is very important here as quoted : "Intelligence isn’t just about how many levels of math courses you’ve taken, how fast you can solve an algorithm, or how many vocabulary words you know that are over 6 characters. It’s about being able to approach a new problem, recognize its important components, and solve it—then take that knowledge gained and put it towards solving the next, more complex problem. It’s about innovation and imagination, and about being able to put that to use to make the world a better place. This is the kind of intelligence that is valuable, and this is the type of intelligence we should be striving for and encouraging."

Her 5 principles through her seen anecdotes and research are as follows.
1. Seek Novelty - being open
2. Challenge yourself - facing slight discomfort (feeling anxiety and fear)- a sense of being at the end of your comfort zone
3. Thinking Creatively - thinking divergently instead of laterally or in the normal context
4. Doing things the "hard" way - the important point of efficiency and your mind adjusting to save energy is not your friend here.
5. Network - Helps you to iteratively reach 1- 4 easier 

"Learning is all about exposing yourself to new things and taking in that information in ways that are meaningful and unique—networking with other people is a great way to make that happen. I’m not even going to get into the social benefits and emotional well-being that is derived from networking as a factor here, but that is just an added perk."

Cheers to learning more , to being uncomfortable . to being open , to being more divergent and to being a better networker [^4]

[^5] is a multi faceted article talking about a lot of nuance of creating small games by abagames. 
Small game definition  - game that concludes within 10 mins and can easily be played on browsers.

The whole page is a wiki on its own and the 12 principles which I would try in the future and write about as well .

The 12 thoughts encompass the following:

1.    A game’s quality is independent from its scale.: Small games are not only easy to create but also to make well. The larger the game, the more aspects within it need attention, and the higher the chance of failure.

2.    A game’s quality is independent from its emotional scope.: Just as short stories function differently from long novels or epics, the conditions constituting “success” vary in small-scale games.

3.   A game defines the terms of its own success.: Accept them as they are, and assess whether that's good or bad.

4.    A game succeeds when it fulfills its promises.: The introduction of new characters or mechanics is a promise. Instead of introducing an interesting idea and quickly abandoning it, ensure it evolves and contributes to the game's overall progression.

5.    It's easier for a game to succeed if it makes smaller promises.: Reduce the mechanics, enemies, assets, characters, and stages. It's easier to introduce three ideas and develop them to a satisfying climax than to juggle 10 or 100 ideas.

6.   Fulfill promises in an interesting and delightful way.: What makes you smile? This is where your personal style shines through in creating a game that feels authentically "you".

7.    Don’t over-deliver on your promises.: Games should conclude at the right moment, not extending unnecessarily.

8.    Form factor is a part of a game’s promises.: Minimize information presented to players, and ensure they can commence playing as soon as the game launches, altering player expectations.

9.    Finish your game before releasing it.: Before releasing under labels like “Demo” or subtitling it “Prologue”, question why you would wish to release it before completion.

10.    Serial games are not a shortcut.: Splitting the game into two or more episodes released over an extended period is almost always a bad idea.

11.    Don’t worry about going viral.: Pursuing small, specific goals in games also attracts a small, specific audience.

12.    Good is good enough.: Once you can consistently create games that satisfy you and feel genuinely good, you’re light-years ahead of many game developers.


Here are the 12 principles that they worked on and a bonus 13th : Have Fun :)!

It's genuinely amazing to develop 139 games in a year but personally a out of the ballpark idea well polished perhaps after the 50th game would really sell this idea of making small games to improve yourself as a game designer and understanding the intriciaies of the market as well as yourself as a gifted programmer , designer , artist with limited toolset and time.
