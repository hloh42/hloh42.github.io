Usefulness is a function of where you are and what you have

2nd Hand knowledge is as good as the source if it distilled through the lens of a expert synthesizer and given in a legible chunk where your mind is receptive to receive the corresponding knowledge in whatever form it takes.

My takeaway from synthesizing all my knowledge and experiences I have read about : 
In the end , it seems that all knowledge can only be self knowledge but you need to learn and organize them in a helpful form before it can be useful to you.

When I read a article , normally I am seeking an answer to a question I have been pondering about for many periods of time and it's when it is the next natural step for my evolution.

Because of your unique upbringing and learning environment in which you would thrive in , many people are like a lion unable to eat grass directly for energy but is able to hunt other animals to convert the meat into proper energy forms where the meat is able to be process for energy. But due to dumb beliefs and tendencies , they refrain from eating meat and thus take themselves out of the race.
