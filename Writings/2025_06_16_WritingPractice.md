><span style="font-size:2.5em;"> Double checking before investing any energy or time </span>

Another painful lesson that took me around 90 minutes to learn.

What surprised me most is the fact that I repeated this lesson even though it already happened once.
I can't help but feel frustration towards myself because this was a repeated lesson , scammed by the flair of the material instead of going throughly  before making the time and energy investment in choosing this as a research material. I was already on the lookout for such an repeat occurance but the fact is that even with the heightened awareness , I still fell into the same trap again. And the same emotions and things still bother me despite me thinking that I have reflected and learnt it for good .

I think that the good vibes that are given off while initially investigating the material misled me to thinking that the material is of utmost quality but it turns out that that is not the case. 

The 1st time I made the mistake , it was of a different nature where I was a beginner and I used an more advanced text for where I am  , I managed to caught it during my pre-read of that book but I had assumed that it was of a suitable level until I read and read and slowly came into a crashing outcome when I realized cognitive overload at simply reading a few lines and nothing was sticking in my mind and I felt something was off and then I consulted with the AI and it confirmed my fears.

The fears that I was using an unsuitable text for my level and I was actually wasting my time.

Overall , I am making process but I feel like I am expecting more from myself and end up perpetually being disappointed by my own efforts instead of acknowledging the orogress of my growth , embracing what has happened before and what needs to happen for me to grow.

I guess it is just a messy affair and I'm starting to find meaning and purpose in my struggle instead of dismissing my own growth like many others have done to me.

All these discounted factors because of the way I was treated while I was growing up , only I can take responsibility for it and then solve it for myself.
