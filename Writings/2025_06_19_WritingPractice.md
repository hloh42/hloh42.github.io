><span style="font-size:2.5em;"> Reflecting on subtracting instead of adding to complete problems</span>

'-' minus to solve problems instead of adding to resolve issues. Indeed , the default is to add things to complete more things instead of subtracting to remove objections to be more satisfied and thus solving the problem. This triggers a thought in my head where the gameplay is using subtraction to solve the puzzles of this game instead of adding to more problems.But I wonder how the gameplay would look like and how it work , even though it's subtracting it's able to add the overall..

My mind is full of contradictions but it feels like the right track.
To subtract is to add to the meaning and solves the problem is what my mind is thinking about.
'Positives to Negatives'
When adding too much becomes a negative , a burden and you need to remove to resolve the issue but it has to be subtle and not obvious otherwise , I think it loses its meaning.

I think it has to be done in the manner where earlier stages uses addition to solve but after adding to a certain point subtraction suddenly becomes the obvious answer.

A second idea is 'Maintaining zero' - schedule management game about handling happiness , live as a genius calculating merits and demerits to a tee, aiming for a certain outcome. Example end the semester with 120 stats A with 20 events in x attr

The more I think about the more attractive it is as a concept ,but the more unsure I am of it as a gameplay mechanic that can make a difference in the player experience.

Other concepts that come when I think about it is negative space and how the negative shapes and spaces of a scene conveys meaning as well.

The more I think about the concept the less sense it makes to make it a thing after considering everything.
