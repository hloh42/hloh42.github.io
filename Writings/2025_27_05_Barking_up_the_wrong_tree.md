> <span style="font-size:2.5em;">Barking up the wrong tree or a fish measuring it's ability by measuring it's ability to climb tress</span>

><span style="font-size:1.5em;">Putting max effort into the wrong direction is the most wasteful way of using your energy...but sometimes you just can't help it , when there's no one to point it out , to help overlook your weak spots</span>

Recently I just realized that I have used the wrong resource for my current ability of understanding algorithms and I can't help but lament about the 9 days I have wasted because it was leading me to boredom and I did not notice this connection because the earlier chapters were simple enough to be comprehended. It was not until I have finished the earlier chapters and wanted to preread the later chapters to do a layer of studying to scaffold my learning that I realized that everything was not sticking and it was way too out of my element and that I realized that it was too technical for me as my abilities right now.

It was then that I made a deicision to make a pivot. And looked for better resources.I will do the RLGL tomorrow and see if it is indeed the case. And if it is , I saved future me a whole lot of heartache by being not stubborn for once and adapting to the changing reality.

I feel like I am making great improvements in my life. But my environment still has not improved but my abilities and confidence in myself definitely I see and note a difference. And I want to continue improving along this way.

Didn't purposely want to make a pun out of tree and data structures but things just naturally come together sometimes.

Hopefully you've been climbing up the right trees and getting the right sorts of fruitful outputs in your life.
