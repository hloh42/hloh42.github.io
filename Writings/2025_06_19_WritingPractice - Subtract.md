><span style="font-size:2.5em;"> Reflecting on subtracting instead of adding to complete problems</span>

'-' minus to solve problems instead of adding to resolve issues. Indeed , the default is to add things to complete more things instead of subtracting to remove objections to be more satisfied and thus solving the problem. This triggers a thought in my head where the gameplay is using subtraction to solve the puzzles of this game instead of adding to more problems.But I wonder how the gameplay would look like and how it work , even though it's subtracting it's able to add the overall..

My mind is full of contradictions but it feels like the right track.
To subtract is to add..
