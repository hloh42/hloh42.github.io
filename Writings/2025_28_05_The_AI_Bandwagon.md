> <span style="font-size:2.5em;">The Upcoming Bandwagon</span>

><span style="font-size:1.5em;">Things that stay the same no matter how much things change and no matter how much things appear differently from the fundamentals...</span>

In particular I am thinking of Warren Buffet and Dan Koe at this current moment in time . Whether the old school principles and reality will prevail or the upcoming new way would make a difference. And in my mind , there 's only one simple question to answer , what is true?

No matter how many elegant abstractions and derivatives you can come up from the base rule , the basic equation of input equivalenting with output remains the same. If there is no additional energy coming into the system , where can new output and efficiencies be found and if there's no new energy to be found , the people who are reporting that there's such a way is likely to be a fraud whether they know it or not yet. Whether they believe themselves to be a soothsayer of a new age.

The base promise of AI seems to be being able to automate your process and think beyond your common ideas but it's built on the best practices of humans and pruned by human AI researchers , so the limit of knowledge of these experts will be the limit of these marvelous machines. But the reason why it seems that AI is making waves after waves , is the current paradigm has been shaken and they cannot turn their eyes from the fact that the current workforce can be made much much leaner , a lot of processes can be automated , there's the reckoning of truly how esesntial a worker is discovered through experience, of remote work in the name of public safety during the covid period.

I understand the shinning allure of wanting this machine to take over parts of your thinking and your processes and indeed this is the time to write down your process and offload those portions that can be done to these ceaseless perfect machines but you would soon realize once these jobs are automated that more can be done in it's place , these people with organizational knowledge are still useful but they far outweight the number of needed ones. And in the face of a failing economy, all I can see is a storm forming.

The conclusion though not drawn yet but the outcome is not one of the beholder but it is for the ones with the foresight and knowledge to see.
