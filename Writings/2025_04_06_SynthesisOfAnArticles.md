[^1] This article taken me 63 minutes to read and thoroughly digest and understand this article and make this understanding my own. I wouldn't say that I have 100% understood and internalized the principles taught in this article yet.This is however my earnest attempt at making this reading a part of me.

Firstly , I think I misunderstood the meaning of the word prompt due to the timing of the article , at first I thought that the word prompt was referring to AI prompts to improve but halfway through by the 1st six principles I already realized that it is referring to memory prompts.

The main point of the the article is for : Readers who read the article to be able to form prompts that increasingly in their usage , activate the mental circuits in mind to truly understand and recall the target idea that the learner wants to engage in.

Six main principles of 
1. Focused 
2. Precise 
3. Consistent 
4. Tractable
5. Effortful 
6. Tightly Scoped (which might be a off shoot of the entire thing or part of the whole strategy)

6 Questions to help you along your mastery internalization journey : 
Is it about one thing only? (Focused)
Is it unambigious? (Precise)
Same answer every time ? (Consistent)
Can I almost always answer? (Tractable)
Does it require recall? (Effortful)
Is it neither too board nor too narrow? (Tightly Scoped)

And 1 key question to keep it all on track : What would it mean to "know" the material?

And the separation of knowledge concerns : (Categorizing into Conceptual , Procedual , Factual)
Factual is quite straight forward.
Proceduals - split into key words , conditions and heuristics prove useful to learners.
Conceptual - About modelling conceptually , what it is , and why it matters.

And it can also be split among Salience prompts , Creative Prompts and Retrieval Prompts which is about the main purpose of the article - how to craft for them.

Summarizing it all and all , it helped me clarify and fine tune the different points of a learning journey and different prompts that can be used for different reasons to help with different purposes of your learning journey , hopefully my breakdown can help you frame your learning even better and I have made the learning explicit enough for you to pick up in probably 15 minutes instead of the 63 minutes to breakdown and understand.

But the learning probably exists within your struggle so go ahead and pick it apart on your own.

PS : I didn't think just reading and trying to apply this understanding would take so much cognitive effort to organize my mind and comprehend the knowledge and then output into a comprehensible form for others to relate and contribute to.
