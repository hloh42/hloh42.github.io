The practiced ability to find the right measure between doing too much and too little in any part of life.
As a budding writer writing with the amount of time that I have to properly structure the workload I am given and have to learn each day , it seems hard to even hold on to this writing habit to even progress.</description></item><item><title>6th Dec 2025 -Entry- Getting Better</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/6th-dec-2025-entry-getting-better/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 22:36:41 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/6th-dec-2025-entry-getting-better/</guid><description>Getting Better
Tracking my progress over time , I can tell that I am getting better and not deluding myself , but the growth is more rewarding than I first assumed and slower than I thought.
I can focus now easily for at least 5 hrs attending to key tasks everyday that makes me work and my work ethic and discipline is getting better.
The more failures I go through the more I am aware of the pitfalls that are encroaching me even when they are not yet close and I can start preparing for them.</description></item><item><title>4th Dec 2025 Expanding Fdf</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/4th-dec-2025-expanding-fdf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 19:19:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/4th-dec-2025-expanding-fdf/</guid><description>Breaking my own limits - Wrongful effort applied perhaps
3 hours of concentrated tireless work , breaking not just the limit of the project but also the limits of my frustration and focus as well , despite being the &amp;ldquo;worst&amp;rdquo; time of my current limits , it was also the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; improvement I could have made for myself.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know a simple map loading would take so much out of me , so much to learn and to consider and so much to appreciate about the work of others to make something simple and to make it work the way I envisioned it in my mind.</description></item><item><title>3rd Dec 2025 Entry Learnings and Reflections</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/3rd-dec-2025-entry-learnings-and-reflections/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 23:35:35 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/3rd-dec-2025-entry-learnings-and-reflections/</guid><description>Feeling the heat..to remain on the path.
Making progress but not enough , not deep enough to make a dent in the amount of expertise to be counted as good enough. Writing just because I have decided and made a point to write even when my thoughts are not gathered and this is my way of outputting even when my mind is racing and disorganized , making progress in my godot project.</description></item><item><title>2nd Dec 2025 All It Takes Within to Continue the Habit</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/2nd-dec-2025-all-it-takes-within-to-continue-the-habit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 23:17:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/2nd-dec-2025-all-it-takes-within-to-continue-the-habit/</guid><description>Just before I sleep , so I can rest in peace. All it takes of me , is the effort of a tremendeous struggle , but a choice made not in heat but one of committed deed. To choose to write when uninspired , when all within is calling me to retire. When all I feel is doubt all around , but I push back with my fingers lightly pounding on this sliver chasis.</description></item><item><title>1st Dec 2025 2nd Entry Recursive Learning</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/1st-dec-2025-2nd-entry-recursive-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:18:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/1st-dec-2025-2nd-entry-recursive-learning/</guid><description>Being aware of learning as a recursive activity rather than a straight-forward one. Learning is not a one and done like most people assume it to be.And often it is less straight-forward than initially assumed.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take the learning goal of wanting to master git for the purposes of wanting to get better at cooperating as a software engineer.
But besides the layer of communication that happens at each level of push-pull , committing and branching.</description></item><item><title>1st Dec 2025 Entry - Writing Out Loud</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/1st-dec-2025-entry-writing-out-loud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 18:56:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/1st-dec-2025-entry-writing-out-loud/</guid><description>This is my 10th post for chaining my writing behavior.
The one thing that I am reflecting on right now is that how clarity makes a difference in progress, when I have a clear picture of what to do and it removes the miasma of uncertainty , it allows me to leverage much more of my energy to execute on what matters and when I progress , it just feels so good especially if I feel stuck on it for quite some time.</description></item><item><title>29th Nov 2025 Entry</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/29th-nov-2025-entry/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:15:23 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/29th-nov-2025-entry/</guid><description>A natural stake.
The last few days I have been spending more time understanding html , css and Hugo rather than working on my writing.
It feels hard to concentrate and carry on your daily tasks if you know something is broken and it needs to be fixed and you are not quite up to knowledge or task yet to fix the issue.
Spending at least 3hr collectively + another 75 mins to finally understand what baseof.</description></item><item><title>25th_Nov_Entry</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/25th_nov_entry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 22:52:18 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/25th_nov_entry/</guid><description>List to do for fdf - estimated time 4 - 5 days + 3 evals ( 1 day ) Made massive progress for fdf today. Left the string parsing for hexdecimals, a centralized cleanup function similar to what was implemented in my pipex to clean up for the fdf data struct for all the points drawn on screen.
Having clarity around objectives and have a method and strategy to undertake the task is immensely helpful for the mind to focus on.</description></item><item><title>23rd Nov 2025 Writing Habit</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/23rd-nov-2025-writing-habit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:40:42 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/23rd-nov-2025-writing-habit/</guid><description>Introduction It has not been easily to be vulnerable , to take in all the mistakes I am making and will continue to make in pursuit of my goals. To be accepting of who I am and yet be seeking to be more. What a oxymoron it feels to be human and yet it feels like to be human is to be like this all the time.
To monitor one&amp;rsquo;s growth and thoughts over the time and effort it takes to transform, it is a really humbling path to be taking day-in and day-out.</description></item></channel></rss>
