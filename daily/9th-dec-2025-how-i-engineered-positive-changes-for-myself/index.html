<p>The problem I faced was myself.</p>
<p>How I was acting against the good that I wanted to develop for myself.
And how I managed to banished the bad, step by step, procedure by procedure.</p>
<p>I used to dislike exercise and nowadays without doing a simple set of exercise of 24 diamond push-ups , 30 assisted L-sits.</p>
<p>Nowadays I have to do 1 set of it daily unless it doesn&rsquo;t feel like the day even started for me.</p>
<p>A New me was born but when was it born under all the struggle and changes I have engineered for myself or during the simple mechanical execution where I felt like it was meaningless to carry on or was it during the many moments where it felt so impossible to start but when it started it felt so easy and I pondered what stopped me in the first place to now current where I still struggle with starting somedays but it&rsquo;s no longer the biggest issue where it used to be and it feels like expanding it as the next step.</p>
<p>So how did I engineer such a change within myself?</p>
<p>The first rule was not to rely on motivation no longer as fuel. As circumstances change , it can be difficult to sustain your fuel in the beginning of your journey and as you achieve &ldquo;success&rdquo;, you might lose your reason to begin like I had for 2 times I had gain and lost weight based on circumstantial fuel but once I felt like it was accomplished , I reverted all the way back.</p>
<p>The second rule was to do it for myself. Not for any other person whether it&rsquo;s related to love or hatred attachment. Because I have self-love for myself and I want to live a healthy and long life.</p>
<p>And as I made one change at a time , and improve my life with each new testcase everyday by assessing the changes made and how it impacted my life by recursively measuring what each change made, it was done with precision and knowing how each input like caffeine affecting my sleep up to 6hrs prior.</p>
<p>To engineer such a change is easy when you understand your own fuel and am ready with each if else to manage when it comes your way when you understand what you are doing it for and to carry it out impersonally.</p>
<p>May you engineer your own success in life as well.</p>
