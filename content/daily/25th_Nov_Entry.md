List to do for fdf - estimated time 4 - 5 days + 3 evals ( 1 day )
Made massive progress for fdf today. Left the string parsing for hexdecimals, a centralized cleanup function similar to what was implemented in my pipex to clean up for the fdf data struct for all the points drawn on screen.

Having clarity around objectives and have a method and strategy to undertake the task is immensely helpful for the mind to focus on. 

It also helps the mind settle into deciding what to next and getting efficient at how to do it.
