A natural stake.

The last few days I have been spending more time understanding html , css and Hugo rather than working on my writing. 

It feels hard to concentrate and carry on your daily tasks if you know something is broken and it needs to be fixed and you are not quite up to knowledge or task yet to fix the issue. 

Spending at least 3hr collectively + another 75 mins to finally understand what baseof.html and hugo and layouts and partial with their command heads , how it all works together.

But what I learnt from this failure and usage of AI is that natural curiosity and doing your own projects do produce the most amount of growth. When you are personally involved and feeling the cost of the project , that's when it hurts the most and that's when the most learning can happen even in a short time period , so to learn to enjoy the struggle and the process as part of the journey.

When it matters, you learn . If you fail , you learn. If you succeed , you get external validation of some forms. So it's all win.
