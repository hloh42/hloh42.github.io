Most people think consistency gets easier. They think after 60 days, the work becomes automatic. That hasn't been my experience.

The grind itself never gets easier. The weight of the barbell doesn't change. But you get stronger. You have more tools. You have the memory of past success.

Consider "Walking."

    To a baby, walking is an impossible struggle.

    To an adult, walking is effortless.

    To an elderly person, walking becomes a struggle again.

The task (Walking) never changed. Gravity didn't change. The person changed.

This is why you shouldn't call yourself a "failure" if you are struggling today. The task is just a constant. You are the variable. Give yourself a longer timeline, and you will learn to walk past this challenge.
