Breaking my own limits  - Wrongful effort applied perhaps

3 hours of concentrated tireless work , breaking not just the limit of the project but also the limits of my frustration and focus as well , despite being the "worst" time of my current limits , it was also the "best" improvement I could have made for myself.

I didn't know a simple map loading would take so much out of me , so much to learn and to consider and so much to appreciate about the work of others to make something simple and to make it work the way I envisioned it in my mind.

Ambitious for the wrong purpose but definitely an creative application of my c knowledge and graphics application of mlx.

Using python scripts to call from mapbox , using curl messages to check the http status of the websites, generating my own tokens from mapbox , dealing with dead ends and my own growing frustrations.

What exactly was my motivation? I myself am not very clear but it just felt like a point of pride and not wanting to admit defeat. In the future , if a similar situation arises , I might avoid doing so , avoiding in taking part of the sunken cost fallacy and stop where I feel like I am overinvesting and not getting the equal amount of satisfaction back.

It took me quite a bit of time to research and learn about DEMs (digital elevation models) navigating gdal and using the earthexplorer.usgs.gov to find Singapore's heightmap and I want . I don't know why I was so adamant about rendering the Singapore archipaelgo to make my project stand out and as a test of my own skill. 

But due to that , I learnt about my singlemindness. And have the experience of work that works. It was frustrating in the moment but when I think about what I have gained in exchange of that experience , it was worth the trade because it sprang from my own curiosity and interest.
