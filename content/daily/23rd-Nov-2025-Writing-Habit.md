## Introduction

It has not been easily to be vulnerable , to take in all the mistakes I am making and will continue to make in pursuit of my goals. To be accepting of who I am and yet be seeking to be more. What a oxymoron it feels to be human and yet it feels like to be human is to be like this all the time. 

To monitor one's growth and thoughts over the time and effort it takes to transform, it is a really humbling path to be taking day-in and day-out.

Writing this daily post is something I am slowly getting used to and something I hope to hone so that it may bring value through the efforts of renewing my organization of my mind and bring timely information to whom it is conveying to.

Today , I have managed to struggle to do all these daily stretching goals I have set for myself again. But it seems like such a slog right now. Simple but difficult to pull off.
