This is my 10th post for chaining my writing behavior.

The one thing that I am reflecting on right now is that how clarity makes a difference in progress, when I have a clear picture of what to do and it removes the miasma of uncertainty , it allows me to leverage much more of my energy to execute on what matters and when I progress , it just feels so good especially if I feel stuck on it for quite some time.

I have noticed for certain habits, chaining it for more than 21 days for a weaker habit, it will allow me to carry the newer habit with a much lower energy threshold , but for stickier habits , it might take more than 60 days for me , I have noticed and even then for that particular habit , it still might come back with a vengenance when you least expect it.

When maintaining the awareness of what is causing the resistance , often it is symptomatic of another deeper cause and it is okay to be frustrated but one needs to keep carrying on , considering and mapping out what else could be the issue.

Voting practically to become the ideal version of me with each rep of my chosen behavior - I am getting closer to . But without reflecting and taking record of the progress made , I would have lost motivation a long time ago.

A small difference that made a large difference.
