Most people think consistency feels like easy once they formed the habit of getting past the 21/30/60 day period , but I don't that view from my experiences.
 
Every day is a choice but each decision that is aligned makes each subsequent choice that follows a lot easier because you have sunken cost fallacy in the way of your right direction. But the grind itself..it doesn't feel easier.but you do get stronger , you have more tools and more preparation against the same circumstances and you have the memory of success once you pulled through.

It gets easier in that sense but the task itself remains at the objective level but your relationship with it has vastly changed because the experience of success has changed your view with it.


So what used to be easy can be also hard , consider when you are a baby and you learned to crawl on all fours and then subsequently walk and then consider this , when you age and your muscle lose strength and you struggle to even walk again. Yet the task of walking from when you were a baby , a young adult , a working adult , a retiree and even when you lost your strength again, the task itself has remained the same but you have changed so much in this twilight of a time.

So there's no need to be too hard on yourself if you think you are a "failure" right now. When you think about the longer timeline and give yourself a more generous timeline , you are just on the way.The task remains there. And you can learn to "walk" past this challenge.
