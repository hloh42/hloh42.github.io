Today, I built a workflow that enables to run a script to convert my online articles on this domain into a book. And by the tags identified , it can compile into a pdf in a nanosecond, ready to be sold as a digital product.

A year ago, this might have taken me a week of reading Pandoc documentation , fighting Latex errors and debugging Python scripts. Today , it took me forty minutes and maybe 4 prompts.

But here is the uncomfortable truth : I didn't write the script. I didn't struggle through the "tutorial hell." 

I thought about my business needs as a business owner and what I need from my business and translate that into script and codes of this pipeline I have formulated. 

But does this count as learning? I would say not because nothing struggled in this process and nothing much has entered my brain other than the required inputs and outputs.

My role as a business owner has been simplified a lot but my role as a developer is shifting..

My input - "I want to make this content structure automated by identifying it by tags."

AI Input - import os , ...

I didn't struggle with the process , I envisioned the end and start point and gave the instructions to the AI.    

If the script breaks tomorrow , I might struggle a little to fix it.   

But this is the trade-off confronting each and every one of us right now.  
And I wonder how worthy is this trade-off for the worker and for the company in exchange for this speed and whether this is healthy for anyone in the longer run.  

But for now I just need to run 2 commands and the work is done.  
python3 compile_book.py && pandoc compiled_draft.md -o completed_work.pdf
