Setting yourself up for success is crucial if you want to endlessly keep going.
And if your goal is to keep going - then it's an endless game where the time horizon is infinite and you can never lose if you don't give up.
The way you think about the process also changes depending on your constraints.
And once you keep the ball rolling , it seems to sustain itself. Like a phoenix being reignited in fire.
For as long as your inputs can outlast your expectations, you can keep going.
