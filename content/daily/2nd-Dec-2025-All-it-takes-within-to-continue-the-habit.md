Just before I sleep , so I can rest in peace. 
All it takes of me , is the effort of a tremendeous struggle , but a choice made not in heat but one of committed deed.
To choose to write when uninspired , when all within is calling me to retire. 
When all I feel is doubt all around , but I push back with my fingers lightly pounding on this sliver chasis.
Click-Clack a chapter is found. 
1 more day of effort and peace is just abound.
