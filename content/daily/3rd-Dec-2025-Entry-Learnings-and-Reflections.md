Feeling the heat..to remain on the path.

Making progress but not enough , not deep enough to make a dent in the amount of expertise to be counted as good enough. Writing just because I have decided and made a point to write even when my thoughts are not gathered and this is my way of outputting even when my mind is racing and disorganized , making progress in my godot project.

As simple as it is as a program , it needs to put together and needs to be cared for to make it work as a package. Need more time to put it together is my current feeling but have my 42 projects to do as well.
