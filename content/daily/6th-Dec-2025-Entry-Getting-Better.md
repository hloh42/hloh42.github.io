Getting Better

Tracking my progress over time , I can tell that I am getting better and not deluding myself , but the growth is more rewarding than I first assumed and slower than I thought. 

I can focus now easily for at least 5 hrs attending to key tasks everyday that makes me work and my work ethic and discipline is getting better.

The more failures I go through the more I am aware of the pitfalls that are encroaching me even when they are not yet close and I can start preparing for them.

It seems inevitable even at this stage that if I keep improving my process like I am doing so.

Even so , it is difficult to keep the effort up and to not let up even for a single day so I can keep chain my own personal success and keep getting better.
