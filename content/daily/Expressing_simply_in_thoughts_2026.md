(Updates) I will be making changes to my current hugo site as well.

It probably will be creating a section about how to create your own github site and set it up using hugo and then how to obtain your own domain and subsequently transferring all of these writings/assets onto my own self-hosted instance of repo of nextcloud.



(State of mind)Writing this out of a habit of writing it.

Making the implicit explicit is not the simplest of habits as we all make sense of the known from the unknown at first. 
One of the key things that I learn about myself from going through the core and piscine is the habit of getting used to the unknown and figuring out things as they come and as knowledge starts to make sense as I start struggling and learning as I go along. 

Refactoring my ideas into more modular and expandable forms than they are right now. 

What I mean is that at one point , just writing ft_split with libft and learning how Makefiles work was overwhelming at the point of time but now I have to be able to do it on the fly and solve it within 3 hours to pass exam rank 02 and I made it.

My ft_split used to take all 5 functions and a struct but that was the understanding and my best at that point of time and took me 2 days , now I can rewrite ft_split with 2 functions under 75 lines , the challenge and transformation that happened wordlessly , so this is one of those improvements I can observe from my own skills over time.

Looking forward to more skill improvements and better guides and breakdowns of projects from me by thinking things through and attempting to explain them in words and images as concise as I can.

I will be uploading this just as it is as the 1st pass to compare against my future self.
