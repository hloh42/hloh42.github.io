It's the start of a new game jam. 
And the theme is Rogue (1983).

My experiment engine of choice is raylib.

Excitement builds while I see my 1st web assembly compilation.

1st python 3 local build , viewed on local browser
![itch.io successful test submission](/GameLikeJam7/1st_build_successful_upload.png)
It's really working!!!!! on actual itch.io draft page. 

My 1st gamejam I tried to be ambitious and have a c# solution that works for both unity and godot4 and failed at the finishing line this time , I won't be making that mistake again.

This time it's tested , its uploadable on day 1. 
Let's see how far we can go!!!
