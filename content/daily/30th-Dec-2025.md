Stuck , not sure what to write to progress in my life.
When I feel uncertain , I tend to cower. And when I cower, it tends to spiral towards the negative side of things.
So I'm just typing , typing my fears away.
Hoping that just taking action , will lead me to the next step and the next.Typing has it's own momentum and the more I type the lesser I see the path ahead.
Two desires one head , one wanting to form good habits and willing to suffer , one wanting short term pleasure at all causes.
Progress is steadily made without fanfare or flair. By putting care in the things that matter in life. By picking well . By knowing yourself well.
Using the limited energy you have in this short life to have the best output in life.
Choosing the "right" words to bring the point across.
Choosing the right activities by breaking down the lifestyle I chose to live by.
