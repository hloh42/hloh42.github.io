Lately I have been reading the book - Great Coaching Questions by Nick Howell and applying the learning layer method as much as I can as taught by Justin Sung to get the most of learning. 

This is the 2nd layer of learning that I am interleaving this week. And I can find myself making new connections when thinking about the material in the book. In the 1st book , what I hypothesize and consider what the book was all about was all about cognitive flexibility and expanding your vision for greater success.

For me generally rather than coaching other people , I am using it as a tool for self-coaching. 

Having this primed version and this understanding , the book reads differently as I explore the concepts on the 2nd pass as I consider this lens for every concept and it make my learning deeper and more relevant as I consider how each points reinforces this point and whether my hypothesis is right in the 1st place.

And I realized as I make my 2nd layer of learning , what I am capable of reading and process is a lot more than the 1st layer and making this multi-pass makes so much sense and efficiency that I wonder why I didn't naturally do this earlier and am thankful for the guidance and course to learn about thisand to apply it to my learning. 

I will be sharing my aim and shoot/skinned version once I finished processing at this 2nd level and exploring how to use this skill. And looking forward to learn more.
