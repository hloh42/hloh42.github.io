Learning to write a single point to the home well.

Today's focus is on just leveraging on a single thing and doing that one thing well. Actually doing well for a certain skill requires you to operate wholeheartedly to support that single goal. 

A simple goal may be to write every day like what I am trying to do right now, depending on the depth of skill required. 

Just to write everyday consistently , I need to change a bunch of cues and habits to think and eat effectively to focus in the time needed to successfully fulfill this goal.

I need to gain awareness of the steps that leads to the step of writing consistently and the obstacles within and without . Then experiment with what tools and how to reduce the friction to constantly make progress in this small enough goal to build enough intrinsic motivation to keep the spokes moving.

All this to say , simple is not so simple when you try to do it.

To the single point.
