Being aware of learning as a recursive activity rather than a straight-forward one. Learning is not a one and done like most people assume it to be.And often it is less straight-forward than initially assumed.

Let's take the learning goal of wanting to master git for the purposes of wanting to get better at cooperating as a software engineer.

But besides the layer of communication that happens at each level of push-pull , committing and branching. To be effective , you need to understand the whole project as a system, managing other's strengths and time in different tasks and the needs of the project from a stakeholder's point of view while communicating the progress that is made.

And just when you thought the learning is getting complete when you are getting used to the hang of it , an incident happens and you need to reflog and check the logs and learn how to save the last branch and commit made.

Learning is recursive.
One layer at a time.
Deeper , and yet simpler at each rung.
The learning concludes when one is done.
