Mesotes 
The idea that virtue exists in balance, not at the extremes. 
The practiced ability to find the right measure between doing too much and too little in any part of life.

As a budding writer writing with the amount of time that I have to properly structure the workload I am given and have to learn each day , it seems hard to even hold on to this writing habit to even progress. But I write as uninspired as I am , not trying to pollute the world with recycled but well-thought out ideas. 

Balancing myself with the fire of desire that is burning bright within , and acting impassionately with precision with every rep of coding to get more skilled and knowledgable about systems programming and remaining balance and calm with each impending challenge/failure when modelling the inputs and outputs that make up the complex system that I am trying to understand that is the world and myself.

Just writing one more rep, one more chapter , one more line , to push , to learn , to be just a little better practically than potentially.
