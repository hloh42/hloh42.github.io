Testing out this version 2 type of daily post. It took me 25 mins to stop distracting myself from all the bells and whistles that Hugo and my ideas can take me before getting to the main task of writing today's daily task. 

Today , is the 1st time where I naturally felt the activation of my curiosity because I felt obsessed over the graphics pipeline in C and how I can learn about it and use it in my graphics project of fdf.

The idea of transforming from the object space , world space, view space to screen space and then using mathematics to transform all these simple stuff into a constantly rendering loop to simulate some abstraction of reality to recreate a simulacarum of the working world which we breathe in daily. 

It confuses me greatly , because I understand these components individually . But when it comes to making it in together to output. It's harder than it seems but easier than I thought.

Making progress line by line...
