# How long estimated would a loop of 30 seconds motion graphics done in davinci resolve take for a beginner to recreate?

For a **beginner recreating a 30-second motion graphics loop in DaVinci Resolve**, the estimated time needed can range **from 6 to 15 hours or more**, depending on complexity, familiarity with the software, and the style of motion graphics you’re aiming for.

---

## **Breakdown of Time Estimate**

- **Learning the Basics (2–4 hours):**
If you’re new to DaVinci Resolve and its Fusion page (where most motion graphics are created), you’ll need time to understand the interface, node-based workflow, and basic tools[^1][^7].
- **Planning \& Asset Preparation (1–2 hours):**
Sketching your animation, collecting or creating assets (images, icons, video clips, etc.), and setting up your project.
- **Building the Animation (3–8 hours):**
    - Creating backgrounds, animated titles, shapes, and transitions[^1][^7].
    - Applying keyframes, timing, and refining motion.
    - Adding effects like fades, pops, or animated lines.
    - Testing loops for seamless playback.
- **Troubleshooting \& Exporting (1–2 hours):**
Fixing issues, adjusting timing, and rendering the final loop.

## **What Affects the Time Needed?**

- **Complexity:**
Simple animated shapes and text are faster; intricate, multi-layered animations with lots of effects take longer.
- **Experience:**
If you’re already familiar with node-based systems or have used After Effects, you’ll move faster[^1].
- **Tutorial Use:**
Following step-by-step tutorials (like [this one][^1] or [this one][^7]) can speed up the process but still requires pausing and repeating steps.

---

## **Beginner Feedback**

- Beginners often find that even with good tutorials, things move quickly and require frequent rewinding and experimentation[^1].
- After a few cycles, you’ll get faster as you learn the tools and common workflows[^4].

## **Summary Table**

| Task | Estimated Time (Beginner) |
| :-- | :-- |
| Learning basics | 2–4 hours |
| Planning/assets | 1–2 hours |
| Animation creation | 3–8 hours |
| Troubleshooting/export | 1–2 hours |
| **Total (typical range)** | **6–15+ hours** |


---

**In summary:**
A beginner should expect to spend a full day or two recreating a 30-second motion graphics loop in DaVinci Resolve, especially if learning as they go. With practice, this time will decrease significantly for future projects[^1][^4][^7].
