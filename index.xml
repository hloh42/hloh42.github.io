Today&amp;rsquo;s focus is on just leveraging on a single thing and doing that one thing well. Actually doing well for a certain skill requires you to operate wholeheartedly to support that single goal.
A simple goal may be to write every day like what I am trying to do right now, depending on the depth of skill required.
Just to write everyday consistently , I need to change a bunch of cues and habits to think and eat effectively to focus in the time needed to successfully fulfill this goal.</description></item><item><title>25th_Nov_Entry</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/25th_nov_entry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 22:52:18 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/daily/25th_nov_entry/</guid><description>List to do for fdf - estimated time 4 - 5 days + 3 evals ( 1 day ) Made massive progress for fdf today. Left the string parsing for hexdecimals, a centralized cleanup function similar to what was implemented in my pipex to clean up for the fdf data struct for all the points drawn on screen.
Having clarity around objectives and have a method and strategy to undertake the task is immensely helpful for the mind to focus on.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/about/</guid><description>About Me This github pages is about my daily writing practice and learnings from doing the ecole 42 program in Singapore.

To be accepting of who I am and yet be seeking to be more. What a oxymoron it feels to be human and yet it feels like to be human is to be like this all the time.
To monitor one&amp;rsquo;s growth and thoughts over the time and effort it takes to transform, it is a really humbling path to be taking day-in and day-out.</description></item><item><title>21st Nov 2025 Entry - Valgrinding the Day</title><link>https://hloh42.github.io/posts/21st-nov-2025-entry-valgrinding-the-day/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 22:22:48 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hloh42.github.io/posts/21st-nov-2025-entry-valgrinding-the-day/</guid><description>Valgrinding the day away , Looking at the mem leaks all day long , 2 hrs , 3 hrs , shaved that bug away, Mind staring , eyes tired..
