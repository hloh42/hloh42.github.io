Dan Sullivan - 

1.Nothing start until you commit to achieving a specifi measurable result by a specific date in your future. After you've made the commitment, courage is required because you have to take action before you've acquired the capability to achieve the result. Capability is actually created because of your commitment and courage. And, finally, confidence is the result of these first three stages.

2.Commitment is the important first stage of The 4 C's Formula because without a strong, specific commitment, you might not have the motivation to even begin. Commitment happens when you make a sale - to yourself. It requires selling yourself on doing something you don't yet have the capability to pull off.


3.When I made that commitment, I didn't yet have the capability of creating the result . Right now, with this second book, I have the capability of doing it twice. I don't have the capability of doing it 100 times. I know how I would go about it, but in order to keep doing it quarter after quarter, a lot of things need to happen, including making the process that we're creating here better and better. Otherwise, it will break down and we won't reach the goal.

That's what commitment requires you to do. It requires you to improve communication and the methods you're using. The moment you commit, you might recognize that there is a large amount of the project you cannot pull off yourself. This immeidately puts you in the courage stage,but you siply have to get as much assistance as you possibly can.

4.Procrastination stops; Courage keeps going.
Often when we think of making a big commitment, wethink of facing fear and uncertainty. Courage is your response too all hese worries and fears, but the important thing is to keep going forward despite the temptation to procrastinate or turn away from the commitment.

The difference btween procrastination and courage is that the procrastinator feels the fear and stops while the coruageous person feels the fear and moves forward.Courage is a willingess to go forward in spite of not feeling confident. The opposite of courage isn't fear; it's cowardice. All of us experience fear, but we can respond to it in different ways.

5.Procrastination : It's the continual activity of trying to improve your life without the energy or power of commitment behind it because you're afraid of the courage that will be required the moment you commit. 

But just think of the experiences you've had every time you actually did start with commitment. Yes , the courage stage that followed was a bit scary, uncertain, and uncomfortable.

But every time you allowed yourself to go through the process, you took a big jump.
And you'll immediately take another big jump if you make a commitment right now.

6.Courage creates capability.

When you commit to achieving a breakthrough in your performance and reuslts, that commitment triggers the courage to go into unknown territory. Courage suddenly puts you in a position where you can fail, and it's scary because you're risking what you've already achieved.

You're betting your past and present on your future.You're taking yourself out of your existing comfort zone,  letting go of your existing confidence to create a higher level of confidence.


7.This puts your brain on high alert that it now has to create an entirely new capability. YOu get a big rush of adrenaline, your sense of urgency sharpens, and your mind simplifies your priorities and decisions. You eliminate all alternatives except success, and you are highly energized to make the breakthrough.

8.The uncomfortable period of courage is also shortened by the strength of your commitment.
The more specific your goals and deadlines are, the stronger and more achievable your commitment will be.


9.Any degree of commitment less than 100 percent automatically extends the period of courage that's required.
You've made yourself liable to somthing, but you haven't given yourself the resources you need to pull it off. You've put yourself in a situation where there can't be a good ending to what you're doing. It's vital never to obligate yourself to something you're not completely committed to.

10.Courage comes into play when you've committed yourself to somehing outside your level of confidence and capability. It's the commitment without the guarantee of capability or confidence that scares you.

11.What entrepreneurs do is voluntarily scare themselves into growth.The ones who voluntarily do it are always enormously more succcessful than the ones who don't because it becomes a skill: They have this skill of continually self-initating their own growth.

12.When people say they admire  leadership, they're actually saying they value courage, because leaders are those who are willing to go into uncharted territory. They're willing to take a risk without a guarantee of success.
Courage is the universal proof of growth.

13.As human beings, we think we're going to be admired for our capability and our confidence, and we strive to hide our commitment and courage. But what's really meaningful and valuable to human beings isn't the payoff - it's the process we all go through. It's the knowledge of a shared experience.

You're really at your most understandable as a human being in the commitment and courage stages, not in the capabilities and confidence stages.

A lot of leaders think that part of their role is not show that they're going through periods of risk and courage because they think it's a weakness and a failure. But that's a mistake. We all want to grow, and courage is the proof that we are succeeding.

14.Innovation occurs in the dynamic thinking zone between courage and capability. The moment you risk your past and present for the sake of a bigger and better future breakthrough, your brain instantly becomes creative, innovative and inventive. 

Innovation requires fear and excitement.

Innovation is the electricity that's generated from the stress and the strain between a future situation you've committed yourself to and not yet having the capability to achieve it.

15.Living a life without courage just doesn't work. You want more capability and confidence, but you have to pay with commitment and courage.

16.It's not about making a general commitment. It has to be a specific commitment. It's not about a general sort of courage. It has to be a specific courage. Our brains don't respond to generalities. Everything must be specific. When human beings operate in an environment where everything is specific, it brings an enomorous level of reality.

17.Commitment and courage must come first.
And it's those who are willing to make those commitments, to take those risks, who gain the greatest capabilities and ultimately the confidence to keep making bigger breakthroughs.
