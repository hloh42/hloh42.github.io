Drawing Planning , Story likely to be changed as it is too real , it doesn't have the sense of wonder that I want to emulate from Space Frog and it has too many complex scenes that doesn't fit my sampling of the story that I want to portray.

One day , space frog decided to go collect a <star>.
<Not just any star though. He wanted the brightest and sparkliest star in the sky.>

However, he could only bring one thing with him in his satchel, since both the ship and his satchel were not very big.

What did he put in his satchel?

The spaceship flew up, up and away into the sky.

It went over the mountains, past the moon, and farther than most frogs could ever dream of going...


Screen 12 : Nothing
But SPACE FROG was no <ordinary> frog.
(On the contrary, his mother told him he was <extraordinary>!)
(She told him this every single day.)

He knew what he was looking for - he just needed to find it.

Where did he steer his ship?

DOWN TO EARTH

OFFSHOOT CHOICES
Screen 21 : Nothing
SPACE FROG landed his ship on the small planet and stepped out.

The blue ground was hard and <rocky.>
rocky.

Screen 22 : Art - Sheep Protrait

SPACE FROG trekked across the pale blue planet and found a little field of white grass.

In the middle of the field was a sheep.

Screen 23 : Nothing

SPACE FROG stared.

The sheep stared back.

"Er... Hello," said SPACE FROG. "I'm looking for a star."

<(It hurt SPACE FROG's feet...)>

Screen 24 : Nothing 

"BAAAAAAAA," said the sheep.

SPACE FROG did not <understand> the sheep.
<(If only he had paid better attention in sheep class.)>

Screen 25 : Art - Question Mark

SPACE FROG wasn't sure what to do. He didn't speak sheep.

Could he communicate with the sheep in some other way?

OFFER SOME SPACE FOOD
BAA BACK

Screen 26 : Art - Space Food
SPACE FROG opened the <packet> of space food.

<(Inside it was a dry block of something that could hardly be called food, but people couldn't be picky about food in space.)>

Screen 27 : Nothing
"Are you hungry...?"

Even if SPACE FROG didn't speak sheep, he knew that everyone liked to eat!

And he was right - the sheep only took one look at the space food before eating it whole, wrapper and all.

Screen 28 : Nothing
SPACE FROG gasped. "You can't eat the wrapper! It's not food!"

But the damage was done. The sheep had already finished eating.

Then, SPACE FROG heard a PLOP.

Screen 29 : Pink Star
SPACE FROG squinted. On the grass behind the sheep, he could see something sparkly...

A big, bright STAR!

Screen 30 : Nothing
"Is... Is this for me?" SPACE FROG asked the sheep.

"BAAAAAAAA," said the sheep. It sounded like a "YES" to SPACE FROG!

"Thank you!" replied SPACE FROG, but the sheep had already trotted away.

Screen 31 : Art - Bag
SPACE FROG managed to stuff the big star into his satchel.

It made for a tight fit inside his little spaceship, but he steered his ship back down to Earth.

Screen 32 : Nothing 
After he landed, SPACE FROG did not go home.

No, he had somewhere else he had to go first.

He checked that the star was still safely in his satchel, and then he headed not for his house, but the one next door.

Screen 33 : Art - Earth Cat
SPACE FROG rang the doorbell. He didn't have to wait long before his best friend <EARTH CAT> answered the door.
<(His name was actually Jay. Nobody called him EARTH CAT but SPACE FROG.)>

Screen 34 : Nothing 
"Hi, SPACE FROG! Sorry, I have to work today, so I can't play with you," said EARTH CAT with a frown.

SPACE FROG shook his head. "It's OK! I'm just here to give you something."

EARTH CAT looked confused. "For me...? It's not my birthday or anything though..."

Screen 35 : Pink Star
SPACE FROG took the star out from his satchel. It glowed bright in his hands.

"I know you've been working late into the night recently, so I wanted to get you a star for light!"

Screen 36 : Hugging Frog - Earth Cat front 2 arms surrounding, Frog back.
For a moment, EARTH CAT didn't say anything.

Then, he gave SPACE FROG a hug. 

Screen 37 : Nothing
"Thank you, SPACE FROG. That's very kind of you." EARTH CAT took the star with a smile.

SPACE FROG smiled back. "No problem, EARTH CAT!"

SPACE FROG gave EARTH CAT a wave before heading back home.

Screen 38 : Nothing
After SPACE FROG got back, he put away his satchel and lied down in bed.

It had been a <good day>...
<He'd gone to space, found a bright and sparkly star, and met up with his best friend, EARTH CAT.>

Screen 39 : Frog thinking of earth cat
"I hope EARTH CAT will have time to play with me soon!"

SPACE FROG closed his eyes and dreamt of the fun adventures he and EARTH CAT could have tomorrow.

THE END

2nd Planet ==================================================================================
Screen 40 : Nothing
SPACE FROG flew his spaceship to the big planet and made a landing.

The red soil was soft but <clumpy.>

<(It would definitely be a pain to clean after...)>

Screen 41 : Art - Bear Portrait
SPACE had only walked for a short while when he came across a little festival stall.

Inside the stall stood a surly-looking bear.

Screen 42 : Nothing
"Hello!" said SPACE FROG, his eyes wide. "I love festivals! Can I play at your stall?"

The bear pointed at the sign next to her.

It read, "FIVE COINS FOR ONE PLAY."

Screen 43 : Art - Question Mark
Five coins was a lot of money...

Did SPACE FROG even have enough?

OFFER SOME SPACE FOOD
ASK TO PLAY FOR FREE

Screen 44 : Art - Space Food 
"Could I trade you for some space food...?" suggested SPACE FROG.

The bear pointed at the sign. "Don't pay, don't play."

Screen 45 : Nothing
Can't I pay with space food?" asked SPACE FROG.

The bear looked at SPACE FROG. "Can't you read? It's five coins for one play."

SPACE FROG looked at his space food. It didn't say how much it cost.

Screen 46 : Nothing 
The bear looked at SPACE FROG for a bit longer and then sighed.

"Fine. I'll trade you for a constellation prize... Just stop looking so mopey."

The bear fumbled around behind the stall.

Screen 47 : Nothing
SPACE FROG was confused. "Constellation prize? Don't you mean consolation prize?"

"I mean what I said," replied the bear, and she stuck out her paw.

In her paw was a little shiny something...

Screen 48 : Art - Blue Star
"A star!" gasped SPACE FROG. Sure, it wasn't too bright or sparkly, but still -

"Now go away," said the bear. "You're getting in the way of my business."

Screen 49 : Art - Satchel
PACE FROG put the little star inside his satchel.

Then, he squeezed into his spaceship and flew back down to Earth.

Screen 50 : Nothing
After SPACE FROG landed, he went back home and took the star out of his satchel.

It was very small for a <star>, and not very bright or sparkly.
<(Honestly, you could call it a glowy rock and very few people would have known the difference.)>

Screen 51 : Art - Frog thinking of star
But he had a nice little souvenir and a good story to go with it!

SPACE FROG could go looking for brighter and sparklier stars tomorrow.

THE END

Screen 52 : Nothing
SPACE FROG steered his spaceship to the lonely little planet.

It was <dark.> He could hardly see a thing.

<(SPACE FROG wasn't scared of the dark... Really, he wasn't!)>

Screen 53 : Art - Rabbit Crying
SPACE FROG journeyed across the dark planet until he found a rabbit standing by a lamppost.

The rabbit was crying.

Screen 54 : Art - Question Mark
"Oh no!" said SPACE FROG. "What's wrong? Why are you crying?"`

Was there anything he could do to cheer up the rabbit?

OFFER SOME SPACE FOOD
TELL A JOKE

Screen 55 : Art - Space Food
SPACE FROG unwrapped the space food and stuck it out towards the rabbit.

"Here! You might feel better if you eat something," said SPACE FROG.

Screen 56 : Nothing 
The rabbit looked from the space food, to SPACE FROG, to the space food <again>.

<(They looked a little suspicious of the space food.)>

"I'm good, thank you," replied the rabbit, who was still crying.

Screen 57 : Nothing
"Are you sure...? You look sad," responded SPACE FROG.

"Oh, do you mean my tears? I'm just making tears for this lamppost," said the rabbit.

"This lamppost?" repeated SPACE FROG. Why would a lamppost need tears?

Screen 58 : Nothing
"It'll be faster to show you," said the rabbit.

They cupped their paws underneath their face, and their tears pooled together...

To form a soft, glowing crystal of light. 

Screen 59 : Blue Star
"Is this a star...?" asked SPACE FROG, eyes wide with wonder.

"A small one, but yes," said the rabbit with a smile. "You can have it if you like."

Screen 60 : Nothing
"But don't you need it for the lamppost?" asked SPACE FROG.

"I'm waiting for the lamp to die out before putting in a new light," said the rabbit.

"If you say so then!" SPACE FROG took the little star from the rabbit, who handed it over with a smile.

Screen 61 : Art - Satchel 
SPACE FROG put the little star inside his satchel.

Then, he squeezed into his spaceship and flew back down to Earth.

Screen 62 : Nothing

After SPACE FROG landed, he went back home and took the star out of his satchel.

It was very small for a <star>, and not very bright or sparkly.

<(Honestly, you could call it a glowy rock and very few people would have known the difference.)>

Screen 63 : Frog thinking of star
But he had a nice little souvenir and a good story to go with it!

SPACE FROG could go looking for brighter and sparklier stars tomorrow.
