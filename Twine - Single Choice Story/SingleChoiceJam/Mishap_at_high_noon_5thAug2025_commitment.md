Bear's character arc : 

Scene 2 : Art of the town - 
Once upon a time, there was a town hidden in the middle of the oasis.

Most of the residents were travellers looking for refuge in a unsafe world.Eventually some settled here making their temporary stay now a permanent one. 

Water was a source of anxiety among the townspeople constantly and it was rationed out like accordingly to their responsiblities they played in safeguarding this city.

Elder Camel was in charge of water rations. Not because he was most competent but because he seemed most confident...

Scene 3 : Art of the main character with cowboy hat and sheriff star
Besides the issue of water, there's also the problem of security especially as the town grew in size from a homely size to something larger.

Someone needed to keep watch to maintain the small peace of this budding town. 

Because of her huge size and large paws and loud roar , <Bear> was chosen to be the sheriff of this small town.

<Bear>'s real name was bearthmelow the third.

Bear was given only had 1 bottle of water and she has to conserve it for sake of the city.

Scene 4 :
Every afternoon , Bear took a path along the outskirts of the city to look out for danger. 

She was playing with her shadows while doing her duty when she suddenly spotted a weird oval shape over the horizon.
Scene 5 :
Approaching the oval, it seems to be a living stone of sorts. With brittle skin and creaks along every corner.

Bear roared at this rock , just for fun.

"That scared me!!!" Popped out a head.

Bear jumped back instinctively..."You're alive?"

The turtle was overturned on her back and barely able to speak.

Bear has only 1 bottle of water on her. Bear wants to help but..

SHARE IT (25% chance to save)
KEEP IT

=========SHARE IT============ (success)
The water revived the turtle, he said "thanks , that brought me back alive. I thought I wouldn't see my grandson again." 

Turtle shared that he came from the west , and if he would gladly lead bear to his home where there's an abundance of water.

On the way ,Turtle shared that he was the lead scout for their expedition.

He was lucky , if not for bear's action today.. 

"If not for your decision to spare water , I might not be able to live to see my grand grand grand son in the future. I will make sure he learns your name. Bearthmelow the third!" Turtle happily walking as fast as he could.

Soon they came into the entrance of a small opening. But it was too small for Bear to even enter.

"I can't enter that!?" 

"That's where I came from and I can get you water whenever you ask."

Turtle looked around and picked a limestone pebble nearby the entrance.

Turtle retched some of his guts on the pebble.

"Just use this stone to summon me anytime.I will get you a container of our freshest spring water."

"How... does this work?..."

"I know my own mark when I <see> it..."

<Actually turtle's home was just very close to the entrance of this opening but he just wanted to act mysterious in front of this youngin. Every pebble thrown this direction bothers his whole household.">

"You saved my life when you barely knew me , give me a chance to repay you , kid."

"Plop" Goes the turtle..


Now the town has a new spot for gathering water while the danger is still present, with 2 sources instead of 1.

<--The end-->

=========SHARE IT============ (failed)

Turtle was now able to talk. 

"I am just 123 years old this year , I hope to fully live out my years..."

"Please , kind bear. I need more wate....r.. to re..cov.." Turtle cleared his stuffed throat.

Bear heaved the weakened turtle into town.

Bear rang the townhall bell and gathered the townsfolk. 

//Wondering if anyone has stoved away any spare water.

//Crane has been diligently storing water for faraway places and volunteered her supply.
//(75% to succeed , if fail , turtle will die)(auto roll)

==========BAD END=============

Even with the extra bit of water , it was a little too late, turtle showed no response.

Dehydration details to be added? Content fit for this age group story?

All the townspeople said their prayers for this passing traveller and they buried this nameless in the ground.

The memoriabillia that they found on him was a pocketwatch with a photo of his family.

5 days later, a younger turtle came by the town.

=========KEEP IT=============
Bear continued on her patrol.

It was lucky she kept her bottle of water on her.

She took off her mantle and her bottle.

She rested at her home.
