Logical Puzzle 

Scene 2 : Art of the town - 
Once upon a time, there was a town hidden in the middle of the oasis , most of the residents were travellers looking for refuge in a unsafe world. 

Scene 3 : Art of the main character with cowboy hat and sheriff star
There was a lot of disputes and chaos in the area always and someone needed to keep watch to maintain the small peace of this small town. Because of her huge size and large paws and loud roar , <Bear> was chosen to be the sheriff of this small town.

<Bear>'s real name was bearthmelow the third.

Scene 4 :
Taking the usual route , the many different dangers were unsavory characters , a occasional sandstorm and the most <deadly> of them all , 

<the mystery of the desertfoot that sometimes arrives in the middle of the day and takes away all of the town's water and then disappears.>
(To be updated : Main conflict)

Scene 5 :
This mystery bothered bear very much as without this water , many residents did not have enough resources to spare if during times of need. And this particular <desertfoot>..

<Was not only terrorizing oasisville but also the neighbouring towns of hot-town and smoke-point
and they also only took cough syrup from them , what a thief! and the only clue they have left each time is it's footprint in the sand.>

Scene 6 :  
Bear was getting sick and tired of always being left in the sand while this outlaw took what little they had and left nothing behind.  


Scene 7 : A stranger appears.
Across the outskirts just 50m away from the town, bear noticed there was a stranger lying on the ground , it was her elderly neighbor mrs viperhead. Her tongue was sticking out. Straight as a line , she laid. 

Scene 8 : Protrait of mrs viperhead.
Do you have any water left? It seems I was visited by the desertfoot last night and I have no water left.I thought I could make it to the distant <marketplace> and get the water by the next town but it turns out that they have been visited by the sandfoot as well.

<This marketplace was a well-known area that is known by all the residents in this part of the oasis as in the middle of the palm trees has a water source , providing life to all of it visitors>
