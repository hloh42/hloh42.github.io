# online 64 bit daw free + guide to make cozy lofi bgm

For making **cozy lofi background music** (BGM) with a **free, 64-bit DAW** online or on your computer, here’s what you need:

**Best Free 64-bit DAWs (2025)**

- **Tracktion Waveform Free**: Fully featured, unlimited tracks, 64-bit support, works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Great for beginners and advanced users alike[^1][^6][^8].

**Quick Guide: Making Cozy Lofi BGM**

1. **Choose Your DAW**
    - For browser-based work, try **BandLab**.
    - For downloadable, fully featured DAWs, use **Tracktion Waveform Free** (cross-platform) or **Cakewalk by BandLab** (Windows).
2. **Set the Mood**
    - **Tempo:** Set BPM to 60–80 for a relaxed, cozy feel.
    - **Key:** Minor keys (like A minor, D minor) often sound more mellow and nostalgic.
3. **Start with Chords**
    - Use soft, jazzy chord progressions (e.g., Am7 – D9 – Gmaj7).
    - Layer with a gentle electric piano or Rhodes sound.
4. **Add Lofi Drums**
    - Use drum kits with vinyl crackle or soft, muffled kicks and snares.
    - Keep patterns simple: laid-back, swung grooves work best.
5. **Melody \& Texture**
    - Add a simple, repetitive melody with a soft synth, guitar, or sampled instrument.
    - Sprinkle in ambient sounds: rain, vinyl noise, coffee shop chatter, etc.
6. **Mixing for Lofi**
    - Use EQ to roll off highs for a “warm” sound.
    - Add gentle compression and reverb for atmosphere.
    - Consider a “vinyl” or “tape” effect plugin to add subtle pitch wobble or noise.
7. **Export Your Track**
    - Render your project to WAV or MP3 for sharing or looping as BGM.

**Extra Tips**

- Many free DAWs come with built-in lofi effects and sample packs.
- Look for free lofi drum kits and instrument plugins (VSTs) online to expand your sound palette.
- Tutorials for making lofi hip hop and chillhop are widely available for most DAWs, including BandLab and Waveform Free[^1][^2][^3][^5][^6][^8].
