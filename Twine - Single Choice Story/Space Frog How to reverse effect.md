# What did the author and creator of space frog have to do to the css and other files to achieve that storybook lite effect

To achieve the **storybook-lite effect** seen in **SPACE FROG!**, the author (npckc) made targeted changes to the CSS and Twine files to create a visually engaging, cozy, and accessible interactive story. While the exact source files aren’t public, the following techniques are standard for Twine games with a similar polished, storybook look, and are supported by community analysis and Twine customization practices:

## **Key Techniques Used in CSS and Twine Files**

### **1. Custom Fonts and Typography**

- **Gentle, readable fonts:** The CSS likely specifies a friendly sans-serif or storybook-style font for body text, making the story feel inviting and easy to read.
- **Larger font sizes and line spacing:** This enhances readability and gives a relaxed, storybook feel.

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Quicksand', 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.25em;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #333;
  background: #faf8ef;
}
```


### **2. Background and Color Palette**

- **Soft, warm backgrounds:** A light, neutral background color (like off-white or pale yellow) mimics the look of a physical storybook page.
- **Consistent accent colors:** Used for links, highlights, and UI elements to create a cohesive, gentle visual theme.

```css
body {
  background-color: #f9f7f3;
}
a, .tw-link {
  color: #5ca4a9;
  text-decoration: none;
  border-bottom: 2px dotted #5ca4a9;
}
a:hover, .tw-link:hover {
  color: #ffb347;
  border-bottom: 2px solid #ffb347;
}
```


### **3. Image Integration**

- **Prominent, centered images:** Each passage likely uses HTML `<img>` tags to display art created in Clip Studio Paint. CSS centers these images and may add soft shadows or rounded corners for a “storybook illustration” effect.
- **Responsive scaling:** Ensures images look good on all devices.

```css
img {
  display: block;
  margin: 2em auto;
  max-width: 90%;
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.07);
}
```


### **4. Minimal, Clean UI**

- **Hiding default Twine UI elements:** The CSS removes or simplifies Twine’s default sidebar, passage titles, and other interface elements, so the focus remains on narrative and visuals.
- **Custom navigation buttons:** If present, these are styled to match the story’s palette and to be unobtrusive.

```css
#sidebar, .sidebar {
  display: none;
}
.passage-title {
  display: none;
}
```


### **5. Accessible, Clear Interactivity**

- **Large, visually distinct links or buttons:** Choices are made obvious, often styled as large buttons or highlighted text, making them easy to click/tap and visually appealing.
- **Consistent visual cues for interactivity:** For example, SPACE FROG! uses a question mark image at choice points, guiding the player’s attention.

```css
.choice-link {
  display: inline-block;
  background: #e0f7fa;
  color: #333;
  padding: 0.75em 1.5em;
  margin: 1em 0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
  font-weight: bold;
  transition: background 0.2s;
}
.choice-link:hover {
  background: #ffb347;
  color: #fff;
}
```


### **6. Subtle Transitions and Effects**

- **Soft fade-ins or transitions:** CSS transitions might be used to gently fade in new passages or images, enhancing the storybook atmosphere without distracting animations.

```css
.passage {
  opacity: 0;
  animation: fadeIn 0.7s forwards;
}
@keyframes fadeIn {
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
```


## **How to Apply This in Twine**

- **Edit the Story Stylesheet:** In Twine, click your story’s name, then “Edit Story Stylesheet,” and paste your custom CSS there[^7][^8].
- **Use HTML in Passages:** Insert images and structure passages using HTML tags for full control over layout and appearance.
- **Test and iterate:** Preview your story on different devices to ensure images and text look good everywhere.
