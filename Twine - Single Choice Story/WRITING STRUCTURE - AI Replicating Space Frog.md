### b. **Gentle, Non-Threatening Stakes**

- There’s no danger or punishment; the story is safe, inviting, and non-judgmental.
- This lets the reader/player project themselves onto the character without fear, making it easier to connect emotionally.


### c. **Second-Person/Direct Address**

- The narrative often addresses the reader directly (“What will you bring?”), inviting personal investment and imagination.


### d. **Flavor Text and Playfulness**

- Clickable asides and gentle humor create a sense of discovery and intimacy, as if the story is sharing a secret with you.


### e. **Childlike Perspective**

- The world is seen through innocent, curious eyes—reminding adults of childhood and validating those feelings for younger players.
