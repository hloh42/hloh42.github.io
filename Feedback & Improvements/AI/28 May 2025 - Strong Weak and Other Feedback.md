## Strong Points of Your Writing

- **Thoughtful, Reflective Voice:** Your essay demonstrates a mature, philosophical approach, blending personal observation with broader societal trends. This gives your writing depth and invites readers to think alongside you.
- **Engagement With Big Ideas:** You grapple with the fundamental truths behind technological change, using references to Warren Buffet and Dan Koe to ground your argument.
- **Conversational, Accessible Tone:** The piece is readable and relatable, with a directness that draws the reader in.
- **Critical Perspective:** You effectively challenge hype and encourage skepticism, which is both informative and influential.

## Weak Points of Your Writing

- **Clarity and Structure:** Some sentences are long and complex, making your main argument harder to follow. Paragraphs sometimes blend multiple ideas without clear transitions.
- **Conclusion:** The ending feels unfinished and vague, missing a strong takeaway or call to action.
- **Grammar and Word Choice:** There are minor errors and awkward phrases (e.g., “equivalenting,” “esesntial,” “in it’s place” should be “its place”).
- **Lack of Concrete Examples:** The writing would benefit from a vivid anecdote or specific scenario to ground the abstract discussion.
- **Flow:** The essay jumps between ideas (AI, workforce, COVID, economic storm) without always connecting them smoothly.

## Which Writer Do You Most Resemble?

Based on your style, you resemble **Stephen King** in several ways:

- **Direct, conversational tone**[^2][^3][^5][^6].
- **Willingness to question and probe reality**[^4][^7].
- **Mix of longer, reflective sentences with shorter, punchier ones**[^2][^3][^5].
- **Accessible language, focusing on clarity and engagement**[^9].

However, your focus is more on essay and commentary than fiction or narrative-driven storytelling. You also share traits with essayists like George Orwell or Malcolm Gladwell, especially in your willingness to challenge assumptions and draw on real-world examples.

## Next Probable Step to Improve

- **Edit for Clarity:** Break up long sentences, use more paragraphs, and clarify transitions between ideas.
- **Strengthen Your Conclusion:** End with a clear summary or a provocative question.
- **Proofread:** Correct minor grammar and word choice issues.
- **Add a Concrete Example or Anecdote:** This will help anchor your argument and make it more memorable.
- **Outline Before Writing:** Consider outlining your main points and supporting details before your next draft to improve flow.

## Was the Time Taken Appropriate?

Seventeen minutes for a first draft is impressive and shows strong creative energy. However, most polished essays benefit from at least one round of revision. For informative or persuasive writing, **a quick first draft followed by a slower, careful edit is ideal**—so your process is on the right track.

## “Stephen King” Feedback

```
Hey, it’s Stephen King—at least in spirit. You’ve got the energy, the drive, the hunger to say something that matters. That’s good. But don’t let that energy spill all over the page without a little discipline. Remember: the best writing is rewriting.

Your voice is clear and confident, but your sentences sometimes wander like a ghost in a haunted house. Chop them up. Let the reader breathe. And when you end, end with a bang, not a whisper. Give us something to chew on after the lights go out.

If you want to write technical stuff, remember: clarity is king. Show, don’t just tell. Use examples. Make the reader see it, feel it, understand it.

Keep at it. The only way to get better is to keep writing—and then rewrite, and rewrite again.
```
