><span style="font-size:2.5em;">Summarization of Articles</span>

><span style="font-size:1.5em;">as recommeded by my own interest</span>

Yesterday's article took me 63 minutes and today's 6 articles took 2hrs double the time to complete. But more than the amount of time taken is my understanding and mastery displayed by digesting and outputting back out your knowledge into your own neural networks and understandings.

And spending the long time yesterday helped today because I decided to delay 1 article until today. And I think I made a good choice of what article to pick and read at the same time to do a sort of deep work to interleave my learning efforts about how to learn.

If my writing has been increasing in quality , I would say its the built up of tacit knowledge through repetitions and the resulting judgements are showing their effects now. And also just writing down what I noted and learnt from the article itself which I have adapted since my 4th iteration of summarizing articles.

[^1] This is the 1st article that have ever sold me on the benefits or rediting or preparing your writing in some structure before submitting it in  , I can see the clear boundaries where 1 topic dipped into another and was interrelated to each topic in a interesting manner.

Example - 25% the main focus of the writing was related to the header and the onus here :

#### the world isn't a meritocracy

@35% -

#### It's all negotiable

And I loved the way how each interesting question header precedes the theme and story that is incoming and ties in it all in for the evolution of the author's thoughts.

@50%-

#### You can often get what you want

And at this point already I can appreciate the structure and overrall theme and understood the title (business psychology)(url) (How running a business changes the way you think) even deeper as I read the article.

I won't bother you with more of my personal analysis but do give it a read if you are interested in thinking about business instead of your direct concerns only : [^1]

This really helped me to see how writing can be taken and done in a different level.Article Saved!

[^2] I was personally triggered by this article slightly as it spoke about 10 principles of growth for engineers.I feel that 4/10 principles disagreeable. It is not really universal and I feel like it's assuming too much goodwill on the part of the company or authorities.The author probably has a good working relationship with authorities growing up but I still think that some of his points still stands.

The top 3 that stands out for me :
Be Professional and Reliable
Own your education
Improve your writing

And 3 that I disagree with :
Take Initiative within the company
Own Your Project Management
Communicate Proactively

Maybe it's a clash of cultural values for me. Finish reading here : [^2]

[^3] Highly engaging piece of writing , well-planned and makes you really think ?
Who is the 1 person you would contact for help if you were ever stuck in a foreign prison and have only 1 lifeline to keep in contact . The attributes this engimatic person would have to come save you ASAP.

The destruction of the normie mind and installation of the chad high agency software: [Then_now.avif]

And the writer made wilbur and oliver's achievement in flight come to live unlike any other piece I have read.

Break your mind : [^3]

[^4]  Very practical anecdote about how to write better , the process to become a better writer and the writer's own personal data tracking to showcase his authenticity and progress as a transparent authority really builds trust and build his case because others can cross verify their knowledge and viewpoints.

Learn to write deeper , better here : [^4]

[^5]This is an article that the author who is still on his learning journey , has not quite realised that in order to write well,  you need to place yourself in the reader's shoe and think about who you are writing for before just outputting your thoughts and assuming you are the authority in this field and start teaching from your point of view.

Give a read to understand about his way of say no to get more impact : [^5]

[^6] This is interesting because this is strongly related to learning themes I am learning about right now and I managed to cut down the number of hours because of the article I digested and now I can compare these conceptual ideas against what I learnt yesterday.

I managed to pick up another new concept : Syntopical Reading.

And now I am scrambling and thinking all about prompts - spaced repetition how it can be utilizied to deepen your learning . In the 1st half of the article  , it talks about certain cogntive principles already well tested but we don't have complete knowledge around all the params to start learning optimally and encourages a scientist or experimental mindset to do all the best we can given all these learnt outcomes.

Read here : [^6]

What I appreciate most : is the author's contranian viewpoint stating that rote memory still has a part to play and it is the foundation for cognition in the 2nd part and how it impacts distributed practice and how you can conceptually not forget anything and how the learning curve which I learnt about yesterday in the interactive comic @ [^7] is naturally related to what you personally find meaningful for you , filtered through your experiences as proven the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve giving me more hooks and cues to remember this as a perpetual learner!

And this multifacted issue continues to puzzle and mystify me in my quest for better learning outcomes.

Absolutely! Here’s a detailed feedback and progression analysis for your 6th iteration, with strengths, improvements, and areas to focus on—especially in relation to your earlier versions.

---

## 🌟 **Strengths**

### 1. **Structural Progression**

- **Headers and Sectioning:** You now use clear headers, timestamps, and even percentage markers to indicate where you are in an article. This helps both you and your readers track the flow of your thoughts and the article’s structure.
- **Footnotes and References:** You’ve adopted footnotes for sources, which is a professional touch and aids credibility and reusability.


### 2. **Depth of Reflection**

- **Meta-Analysis:** You reflect not just on the articles, but on your own learning and summarization process. For example, you note how yesterday’s longer effort improved today’s efficiency and understanding—a sign of deliberate practice.
- **Tacit Knowledge Recognition:** You explicitly mention tacit knowledge and how repetition is building your judgment. This is a mature insight and shows you’re internalizing the learning process, not just the content.


### 3. **Personal Voice and Critical Thinking**

- **Honest Opinions:** You’re not afraid to disagree with an article and clearly state why, offering your own cultural and personal context. This is a sign of critical engagement, not passive consumption.
- **Personal Takeaways:** You highlight what specifically resonated with you in each article, and what didn’t. This helps future-you (and others) see the evolution of your thinking.


### 4. **Engagement and Encouragement**

- **Inviting the Reader:** Phrases like “do give it a read if you are interested…” and “Break your mind” make your writing more engaging and less dry.
- **Connecting Themes:** You link concepts across articles (e.g., “Syntopical Reading” and spaced repetition), showing synthesis and higher-order thinking.

---

## 📈 **Progression Over Iterations**

- **Earlier Iterations:** (If memory serves) Your first summaries were more list-like, focused on “what” rather than “why” or “how.” They were shorter, less personal, and more mechanical.
- **Middle Iterations:** You started adding more personal notes and began experimenting with structure, but sometimes lacked clarity or consistency.
- **Current (6th) Iteration:** You now blend summary, critique, and meta-reflection. Your structure is more deliberate, and you’re clearly aware of your own growth as a reader and writer. You also reference your process improvements (e.g., “since my 4th iteration…”).

---

## 🛠️ **Areas for Further Improvement**

### 1. **Clarity and Conciseness**

- Some sentences are long and winding. For example:
> “But more than the amount of time taken is my understanding and mastery displayed by digesting and outputting back out your knowledge into your own neural networks and understandings.”
Could be clearer as:
> “More important than the time spent is the depth of understanding I gain by actively summarizing and integrating the knowledge.”


### 2. **Grammar and Flow**

- Watch for subject-verb agreement and run-on sentences. A quick proofread or reading aloud can help catch these.
- Example:
> “This is the 1st article that have ever sold me…”
Should be:
> “This is the first article that has ever convinced me…”


### 3. **Formatting Consistency**

- The mix of Markdown headers, blockquotes, and footnotes is great, but sometimes the transitions are abrupt. Consider using more consistent spacing or section breaks for readability.
- You might also use bullet points for lists of takeaways or disagreements for easier scanning.


### 4. **Summary and Synthesis**

- At the end, consider adding a short “Key Lessons” or “What I’ll Apply” section. This cements the learning and makes your notes even more actionable.


### 5. **Audience Awareness**

- You mention “I won’t bother you with more of my personal analysis…” but remember, your future self or any reader may value that context! Don’t be afraid to elaborate if you think it’s insightful.

## 🏆 **Overall Impression**

You’ve made **tremendous progress**—your writing is now reflective, structured, and engaging, with a clear sense of personal growth. You’re moving from “just summarizing” to “synthesizing and critiquing,” which is the hallmark of advanced learning.

**Keep iterating!** If you continue this trajectory, your summaries will not only be a record of what you’ve read, but a map of your intellectual journey and evolving worldview.

**If you’d like, I can provide a sample rewrite of one section to demonstrate even clearer structure and style—just let me know!**
