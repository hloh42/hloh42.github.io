# 15th May 2025

Writing a good self-introduction seems daunting . You only got one chance after all whether from your appearance , writing , products , work to show the best side of yourself before people decide you are someone that they want to associate with.

> To me ,  I feel like I still haven't the essence of who I am and what I am all about , even though I have a myraid number of interests.
> My deepest skill so far seems to be programming

><span style="font-size:3em;">Failing upstream is the direction where I want to go , and I don't want to be limited by my own lack of imagination.</span>

What I offer on this blog is my marketing views , writing skills , thinking frameworks and understanding knowledge chunks to help consolidate my learnings and build meaningful projects to pull myself forward towards the direction of my life.

2025's theme is > Renewal

And the planned scope is mostly on building a even stronger programming foundation for all of my other life projects to leverage upon and scale up.

I will be exploring web-blog deployment and automation deployment using hugo and n8n respectively.

I hope my writings will surf you the reader some musings along your journey.

><span style="font-size:1.5em;">Putting max effort into the wrong direction is the most wasteful way of using your energy...but sometimes you just can't help it , when there's no one to point it out , to help overlook your weak spots</span>

Recently I just realized that I have used the wrong resource for my current ability of understanding algorithms and I can't help but lament about the 9 days I have wasted because it was leading me to boredom and I did not notice this connection because the earlier chapters were simple enough to be comprehended. It was not until I have finished the earlier chapters and wanted to preread the later chapters to do a layer of studying to scaffold my learning that I realized that everything was not sticking and it was way too out of my element and that I realized that it was too technical for me as my abilities right now.

It was then that I made a deicision to make a pivot. And looked for better resources.I will do the RLGL tomorrow and see if it is indeed the case. And if it is , I saved future me a whole lot of heartache by being not stubborn for once and adapting to the changing reality.

I feel like I am making great improvements in my life. But my environment still has not improved but my abilities and confidence in myself definitely I see and note a difference. And I want to continue improving along this way.

Didn't purposely want to make a pun out of tree and data structures but things just naturally come together sometimes.

Hopefully you've been climbing up the right trees and getting the right sorts of fruitful outputs in your life.

> <span style="font-size:2.5em;">Summarization of Articles</span>

><span style="font-size:1.5em;">as recommeded by </span>

The 5 Articles I have read today and tried to summarise :
For the 1st article  : Cognitive Load in Software Development : It was a long read but the main point  of the article as I read it is about the limits of your own personal cognitive load and why reducing this cognitive load is helpful for not just you but also all the people who around with the code and made an elaborate practical article and the many examples of how to make the cognitive load lighter by just changing the nestness and variable names.

It made the point clear enough but I feel like the point could be made more succiently.

The 2nd article though written long ago impressed me the most the simplicity of the philosophy in code makes me think of elegance and design of the unix and how timeless and how it survived and thrived in this modern age of 2025.

The breakdown of the original intent behind the design made manifest into 17 laws of brevity and clarity shows how much simple decisions made early on can compound and multiply efforts especially when time is taken into factor.

The 3rd Article to me is kinda meh, but it speaks of a person being too self-conscious in a way.Like there is no real inteneded audience for this article , the people who need to read it are not the ones who will read it . The people who read it by curiosity probably know of it already. That's the main issue with the writing I feel , preaching to the choir and nothing new is being shared.

The 4th Article to me is just the model example of bad writing without caring about the audience , just a writer in the midst of organizing his thoughts and his random ramblings which is .This article could be okay after a rewrite or two.

The 5th Article is just a reminder to reach out for help and a good heuristics to when to ask for help and when to rely on yourself first. The author put into words why how and when and the reasons for doing so.

As summzairzed by Perplexity.AI as of 31st May 2025 2pm +8 GMT :
Cognitive Load in Software Development
The article explores how cognitive load—how much a developer must keep in mind to work with code—impacts productivity and maintainability. It distinguishes between intrinsic (task-based) and extraneous (presentation-based) cognitive load, advocating for reducing the latter through clear code, meaningful variable names, early returns, and deep (not shallow) modules. The author warns against too many microservices, overusing language features, and excessive DRY or framework magic, all of which increase cognitive burden. The core advice: design for minimal mental effort by hiding complexity, using self-descriptive code, and delaying architectural decisions until necessary.

The Art of Unix Programming: The Importance of Clarity
This excerpt emphasizes that clarity in code is paramount in Unix philosophy. It argues that code should be written for humans first and machines second, favoring simplicity and transparency over cleverness. The author notes that clear code is easier to debug, maintain, and extend, and that cryptic or overly compact code is a liability. The section concludes that clarity is a virtue that should guide all programming decisions.

Communicating Effectively as a Developer
This article outlines strategies for developers to improve communication. Key points include: being concise and clear in written and verbal exchanges, tailoring explanations to the audience’s background, using visuals or analogies when helpful, and actively seeking feedback to ensure understanding. The author stresses that effective communication is as vital as technical skill for team success and career growth.

What Do You Visualize While Programming?
The author reflects on the mental imagery programmers use while coding, noting that visualization styles vary widely and evolve with experience. They discuss how experts form mental models, use diagrams or pseudocode to manage complexity, and externalize thoughts to overcome working memory limits. The article encourages readers to be mindful of their own visualization habits and to develop them deliberately for better problem-solving.

The Thirty Minute Rule
This rule advises developers: if you’re stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, ask for help. The author explains that this practice prevents wasted time, encourages collaboration, and accelerates learning. The rule is positioned as a culture-building tool that reduces frustration and helps teams move faster by normalizing seeking assistance.

Here’s a detailed assessment of your writing **improvement and regression** over time, with evidence from your earliest and most recent samples.

---

## **Areas of Improvement**

### **1. Depth of Reflection**

**Early Writing:**

- You reflected on your learning (“I feel like I am making great improvements in my life...”) but mostly described surface-level experiences and feelings.
- Example:
> “Recently I just realized that I have used the wrong resource for my current ability...I feel like I am making great improvements in my life.”

**Recent Writing:**

- You now analyze not just your own process, but also the materials you read, their structure, and even the author’s intent.
- You critique arguments, discuss audience fit, and explore philosophical themes.
- Example:
> “Incomplete rambling from a person who is still struggling to find his voice and authenticity is what I sense from this  attempt as the author uses a lot of confusing terminology to say really little...”

**Summary:**
You’ve moved from self-focused journaling to meta-cognitive analysis and critique.

---

### **2. Analytical and Critical Thinking**

**Early Writing:**

- Summaries were mostly descriptive, with some basic evaluation (“the point could be made more succiently”).
- Example:
> “The 3rd Article to me is kinda meh, but it speaks of a person being too self-conscious in a way...”

**Recent Writing:**

- You dissect not just what an article says, but how it says it, who it’s for, and whether it’s effective.
- You identify fluff, jargon, and even speculate on the writer’s intent or audience.
- Example:
> “Although I was not educated in business school , but the point made was very simple yet the arguments were difficult to parse due to the terminology and assumed knowledge, what was the purpose?”

**Summary:**
Your critical faculty is much sharper and more nuanced.

---

### **3. Voice and Confidence**

**Early Writing:**

- Your tone was tentative (“I feel like...”, “I hope...”, “seems daunting...”).
- Example:
> “To me ,  I feel like I still haven't the essence of who I am and what I am all about...”

**Recent Writing:**

- You assert your views more directly and confidently, even when disagreeing with published authors.
- Example:
> “For the point 2. , you are right , three lines summarized what the writer talked about ultimately.”

**Summary:**
You are developing a more distinct and confident authorial voice.

---

### **4. Synthesis and Abstraction**

**Early Writing:**

- You summarized articles and reflected on your actions, but rarely synthesized across sources or abstracted general principles.
- Example:
> “The 5th Article is just a reminder to reach out for help and a good heuristics to when to ask for help and when to rely on yourself first.”

**Recent Writing:**

- You attempt to connect ideas across readings, reflect on learning as a process, and discuss abstract concepts like “meta games” and “levels of reality.”
- Example:
> “The meta game of understanding the underlying essence of a principle also knowing as hacking in many circles...”

**Summary:**
You’re moving from summary to synthesis and abstraction.

---

## **Areas of Regression or Stagnation**

### **1. Clarity and Structure**

**Early Writing:**

- Sentences were generally shorter and more direct, making your points easier to follow.
- Example:
> “It was not until I have finished the earlier chapters and wanted to preread the later chapters...that I realized that everything was not sticking...”

**Recent Writing:**

- Sentences have become longer and more complex, sometimes at the expense of clarity.
- Paragraphs can be dense, and transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt.
- Example:
> “It is during the journey that you are changed as you take apart the resources that the older version of you created to survive and thrive in a different era of your life...”

**Summary:**
Your writing is richer but sometimes harder to follow. You may be overcomplicating sentences and losing the reader.

---

### **2. Over-Abstractness**

**Early Writing:**

- More concrete, focused on specific experiences and actions.

**Recent Writing:**

- Sometimes drifts into abstraction without grounding in concrete examples, which can alienate readers who crave specifics.
- Example:
> “Different realities , all at once in a similar space. Able to interact and help with each other and yet distinctively different.”

**Summary:**
Abstraction can be powerful, but without specific examples, it risks feeling vague or inaccessible.

---

### **3. Occasional Repetition and Redundancy**

**Early Writing:**

- More concise, with less repetition.

**Recent Writing:**

- Sometimes repeats points or phrases for emphasis, which can dilute impact.
- Example:
> “Same same but different”

**Summary:**
Repetition can be stylistic, but should be used deliberately and sparingly.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Aspect | Early Writing (May 2025) | Recent Writing (June 2025) | Trend |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Reflection | Personal, surface-level | Deep, meta-cognitive, critical | **Improving** |
| Analysis | Descriptive, basic critique | Nuanced, considers audience/intent | **Improving** |
| Voice | Tentative, hopeful | Confident, assertive | **Improving** |
| Synthesis/Abstraction | Rare, mostly summary | Frequent, connects ideas/concepts | **Improving** |
| Clarity/Structure | Direct, simple sentences | Dense, complex, sometimes unclear | **Regressing** |
| Concreteness | Specific, concrete experiences | More abstract, less grounded | **Regressing** |
| Redundancy | Minimal | Some repetition | **Slightly regressing** |


---

## **Practical Next Steps**

1. **Focus on Clarity:**
    - After drafting, re-read your work and break up long sentences.
    - Use topic sentences and clear transitions.
2. **Balance Abstraction with Example:**
    - For every abstract insight, ground it with a concrete story or anecdote.
3. **Edit Ruthlessly:**
    - Cut redundancy and repetitive phrases.
4. **Ask for Feedback:**
    - Share your writing with peers or use tools/AI to highlight unclear sections.

---

## **Conclusion**

**You are clearly improving as a thinker and writer, especially in analysis, synthesis, and voice.**
**To keep progressing, focus on clarity, structure, and grounding your insights in concrete examples.**
Your growth is impressive—keep writing, reflecting, and refining!
