# Can you give an example where my weaknesses are fixed? and highlight where and how you fixed them and the reasoning behind the fix

Absolutely! Here’s a **revised excerpt** from your original text, with **improvements** to clarity, structure, grammar, and use of concrete examples.
Below the excerpt, I’ll **highlight the changes** and explain the reasoning behind each fix.

### **Revised Excerpt**

> **The AI Bandwagon**
>
> Some things never change, no matter how much the world seems to shift. I’m reminded of Warren Buffet’s old-school wisdom and Dan Koe’s modern insights. In the end, it all comes down to one question: **What is true?**
>
> No matter how many elegant abstractions we create, the basic equation remains: input equals output. If no new energy enters the system, there can be no new value. Anyone claiming otherwise is either mistaken or misleading—intentionally or not.
>
> **Take the current excitement about AI.** The promise is automation and innovation, but every AI system is built on the knowledge and best practices of its human creators. The limits of those people become the limits of the machine.
>
> For example, during the COVID pandemic, many companies discovered that remote work and automation could make their operations leaner. Processes that once required a full team could now be handled by a few people and a handful of scripts. This shift forced organizations to ask: who is truly essential?
>
> The allure of AI is real—offloading tedious tasks to a machine feels liberating. But once those jobs are automated, new challenges and opportunities emerge. The people with deep organizational knowledge remain valuable, but there are fewer roles for them. In tough economic times, that’s a storm on the horizon.
>
> So, will timeless principles prevail, or are we truly entering a new age? The answer belongs to those with the foresight to see what’s coming next.

## **What Was Fixed and Why**

### 1. **Clarity and Structure**

- **Fix:** Broke up long, complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones.
    - **Original:**
“No matter how many elegant abstractions and derivatives you can come up from the base rule, the basic equation of input equivalenting with output remains the same.”
    - **Revised:**
“No matter how many elegant abstractions we create, the basic equation remains: input equals output.”
- **Reasoning:** Shorter sentences are easier to read and understand. Each idea gets its own space.


### 2. **Transitions and Flow**

- **Fix:** Added topic sentences and transitions between ideas.
    - **Original:**
The essay jumped from AI to workforce to COVID without clear links.
    - **Revised:**
“Take the current excitement about AI. The promise is automation and innovation, but every AI system is built on the knowledge and best practices of its human creators.”
- **Reasoning:** Clear transitions guide the reader and show how each idea connects to the next.


### 3. **Grammar and Word Choice**

- **Fix:** Corrected typos and awkward phrases.
    - **Original:**
“equivalenting,” “esesntial,” “in it’s place”
    - **Revised:**
“input equals output,” “essential,” “in its place”
- **Reasoning:** Proper grammar and word choice improve professionalism and readability.


### 4. **Concrete Examples**

- **Fix:** Added a real-world scenario to illustrate the abstract point.
    - **Original:**
“...the reckoning of truly how esesntial a worker is discovered through experience, of remote work in the name of public safety during the covid period.”
    - **Revised:**
“For example, during the COVID pandemic, many companies discovered that remote work and automation could make their operations leaner. Processes that once required a full team could now be handled by a few people and a handful of scripts.”
- **Reasoning:** Concrete examples make abstract arguments relatable and memorable.


### 5. **Conclusion**

- **Fix:** Provided a more direct, thought-provoking ending.
    - **Original:**
“The conclusion though not drawn yet but the outcome is not one of the beholder but it is for the ones with the foresight and knowledge to see.”
    - **Revised:**
“So, will timeless principles prevail, or are we truly entering a new age? The answer belongs to those with the foresight to see what’s coming next.”
- **Reasoning:** A strong conclusion either summarizes the argument or leaves the reader with a clear question or challenge.
