## **June 5 Summary**

### **Best Done: Critical Engagement and Personal Reflection**

Your analysis of the “10 principles for growth” article was particularly strong. You didn’t just summarize—you evaluated, agreed/disagreed, and contextualized the advice based on your own cultural and personal experience.

**Why it stands out:**

- You showed independent thinking by questioning the universality of the advice.
