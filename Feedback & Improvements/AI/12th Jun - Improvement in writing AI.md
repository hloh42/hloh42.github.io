><span style="font-size:2.5em;">Unclear thoughts flowing in a passionate stream</span>

Reading and writing , Input and output , taking what you have and turning it into skills and values that you embody. It is all a part of the learning process and at most times you take 3 steps forward , 2 steps backwards and then 1 step forwards all in the same day and are frustrated with your lack of progress even though you have been placing a lot of effort in your endeavor towards the goal you see and covert.

It is during the journey that you are changed as you take apart the resources that the older version of you created to survive and thrive in a different era of your life. During this journey you may lose track of yourself and your goals as you are just trying to survive to get to another day. As you forget the good intentions and projects set almost a whole cycle before. And that is the what [^3] is trying to show.

Incomplete rambling from a person who is still struggling to find his voice and authenticity is what I sense from this [^1] attempt as the author uses a lot of confusing terminology to say really little seems to be his general audience style. Only his series on tacile knowledge after going into nuances , that I found it a bit interesting.So I know the author is capable of conveying triad of depth , nuance and practicability.[^2]

Wrapping it all up today ,  Don't let the sparkle fool you for the actual thing , listen and observe for belivability and always assess independently for each piece of writing instead of basing it on the branding of the person.

><span style="font-size:2.5em;">Where the true game resides</span>

Hook :  The game within the game is the true game yet it is unnamed until you have the underlying fundamentals yet there are infinite levels to this game.

The meta game of understanding the underlying essence of a principle also knowing as hacking in many circles. It is only accessible to people who have cleared the fundamentals and are playing on a different level of shell(cmd)  /  frame of mind and I think this level of game just keeps going up because it is unlimited in scope , complexity and variables .

To simplify what I mean it is to there are as many games as there are people. Because each viewpoint is playing a different meaning and purpose in this arrangement of time and coincidents or causes with reason with which we are lacking the fidelity to view the complexity at work yet though we can easily feel and experiment the changes immediately with the felt experience.

The practical impliation of this realization is that you really cannot compare to others for any reason at all. It means no worries, and really the only person you should realistically compare is yourself.
And the guiding principle is to give calm to comparing youtself to others who have different capabilities and are capable of different speeds.

Different realities , all at once in a similar space. Able to interact and help with each other and yet distinctively different.

Same same but different

><span style="font-size:2.5em;">Summarization of Articles</span>

><span style="font-size:1.5em;">as recommeded by my own interest</span>

Yesterday's article took me 63 minutes and today's 6 articles took 2hrs double the time to complete. But more than the amount of time taken is my understanding and mastery displayed by digesting and outputting back out your knowledge into your own neural networks and understandings.

And spending the long time yesterday helped today because I decided to delay 1 article until today. And I think I made a good choice of what article to pick and read at the same time to do a sort of deep work to interleave my learning efforts about how to learn.

If my writing has been increasing in quality , I would say its the built up of tacit knowledge through repetitions and the resulting judgements are showing their effects now. And also just writing down what I noted and learnt from the article itself which I have adapted since my 4th iteration of summarizing articles.

[^1] This is the 1st article that have ever sold me on the benefits or rediting or preparing your writing in some structure before submitting it in  , I can see the clear boundaries where 1 topic dipped into another and was interrelated to each topic in a interesting manner.

Example - 25% the main focus of the writing was related to the header and the onus here :

#### the world isn't a meritocracy

@35% -

#### It's all negotiable

And I loved the way how each interesting question header precedes the theme and story that is incoming and ties in it all in for the evolution of the author's thoughts.

@50%-

#### You can often get what you want

And at this point already I can appreciate the structure and overrall theme and understood the title (business psychology)(url) (How running a business changes the way you think) even deeper as I read the article.

I won't bother you with more of my personal analysis but do give it a read if you are interested in thinking about business instead of your direct concerns only : [^1]

This really helped me to see how writing can be taken and done in a different level.Article Saved!

[^2] I was personally triggered by this article slightly as it spoke about 10 principles of growth for engineers.I feel that 4/10 principles disagreeable. It is not really universal and I feel like it's assuming too much goodwill on the part of the company or authorities.The author probably has a good working relationship with authorities growing up but I still think that some of his points still stands.

The top 3 that stands out for me :
Be Professional and Reliable
Own your education
Improve your writing

And 3 that I disagree with :
Take Initiative within the company
Own Your Project Management
Communicate Proactively

Maybe it's a clash of cultural values for me. Finish reading here : [^2]

[^3] Highly engaging piece of writing , well-planned and makes you really think ?
Who is the 1 person you would contact for help if you were ever stuck in a foreign prison and have only 1 lifeline to keep in contact . The attributes this engimatic person would have to come save you ASAP.

The destruction of the normie mind and installation of the chad high agency software: [Then_now.avif]

And the writer made wilbur and oliver's achievement in flight come to live unlike any other piece I have read.

Break your mind : [^3]

[^4]  Very practical anecdote about how to write better , the process to become a better writer and the writer's own personal data tracking to showcase his authenticity and progress as a transparent authority really builds trust and build his case because others can cross verify their knowledge and viewpoints.

Learn to write deeper , better here : [^4]

[^5]This is an article that the author who is still on his learning journey , has not quite realised that in order to write well,  you need to place yourself in the reader's shoe and think about who you are writing for before just outputting your thoughts and assuming you are the authority in this field and start teaching from your point of view.

Give a read to understand about his way of say no to get more impact : [^5]

[^6] This is interesting because this is strongly related to learning themes I am learning about right now and I managed to cut down the number of hours because of the article I digested and now I can compare these conceptual ideas against what I learnt yesterday.

I managed to pick up another new concept : Syntopical Reading.

And now I am scrambling and thinking all about prompts - spaced repetition how it can be utilizied to deepen your learning . In the 1st half of the article  , it talks about certain cogntive principles already well tested but we don't have complete knowledge around all the params to start learning optimally and encourages a scientist or experimental mindset to do all the best we can given all these learnt outcomes.

Read here : [^6]

What I appreciate most : is the author's contranian viewpoint stating that rote memory still has a part to play and it is the foundation for cognition in the 2nd part and how it impacts distributed practice and how you can conceptually not forget anything and how the learning curve which I learnt about yesterday in the interactive comic @ [^7] is naturally related to what you personally find meaningful for you , filtered through your experiences as proven the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve giving me more hooks and cues to remember this as a perpetual learner!

And this multifacted issue continues to puzzle and mystify me in my quest for better learning outcomes.

The 2nd isn't a synthesize article.

Absolutely! Here’s a detailed assessment of your last three articles, focusing on your growth as a writer, with evidence for both improvement and areas to work on.

---

## **Article 1: "Reading Synthesis and Analysis - 11th Jun 2025"**

### **Strengths**

- **Reflective Tone:** You demonstrate metacognition—thinking about your learning and writing process.
- **Critical Analysis:** You directly critique the articles and their authors, not just summarizing but evaluating style, substance, and audience.
- **Personal Voice:** There is a clear sense of your own journey and frustration, which makes the piece authentic.


### **Areas for Improvement**

- **Clarity and Structure:** Some sentences are long and winding, making your main points harder to follow. For example:
> "It is during the journey that you are changed as you take apart the resources that the older version of you created to survive and thrive in a different era of your life."
- **Specificity:** While you critique the articles, you sometimes generalize ("confusing terminology to say really little") without always giving concrete examples.
- **Transitions:** The flow between ideas and paragraphs can be abrupt. Try using clearer topic sentences and transitions.

**Evidence of Improvement:**
Compared to your earlier work, you are more analytical and less focused on just summarizing content. You are also developing a more distinct voice.

---

## **Article 2: "Where the true game resides - 11th Jun 2025"**

### **Strengths**

- **Conceptual Depth:** You explore the idea of the “meta game” and individuality in learning and comparison.
- **Philosophical Reflection:** The writing is more abstract and tries to grapple with universal principles.
- **Encouragement of Self-Comparison:** You distill a practical insight—don’t compare yourself to others, compare to your past self.


### **Areas for Improvement**

- **Abstractness:** The writing is quite philosophical, which can be engaging, but risks losing readers who want concrete examples or actionable advice.
- **Grammar and Typos:** There are some minor errors ("practical impliation," "youtself") that, if cleaned up, would improve professionalism.
- **Repetition:** Some ideas are repeated (“Different realities, all at once in a similar space...Distinctively different. Same same but different.”) without adding new substance.

**Evidence of Improvement:**
You are experimenting with style and theme, showing willingness to move beyond simple summary. The “hook” at the start is a good technique.

---

## **Article 3: "Summarization of Articles - 5th Jun 2025"**

### **Strengths**

- **Comprehensive Summaries:** You provide clear, structured summaries of multiple articles, noting both strengths and disagreements.
- **Personal Reflection:** You discuss your own learning process and how reading habits are evolving.
- **Use of Examples:** You highlight specific sections of articles and what you learned from them.


### **Areas for Improvement**

- **Length and Focus:** The article is long and covers many pieces; some readers may prefer a tighter focus or more synthesis across articles.
- **Paragraph Structure:** Some paragraphs are dense and could be broken up for readability.
- **Explicit Synthesis:** While you summarize well, you could further develop your own “big picture” takeaways connecting the articles.

**Evidence of Improvement:**
You are moving from pure summary to integrating your own perspective and critique, and you show increasing self-awareness about your learning process.

---

## **Overall Assessment**

### **Evidence of Improvement**

- **Growing Self-Awareness:** You reflect more on your own process and reactions, not just the content.
- **Increased Analytical Depth:** Your critiques are sharper and more personal, especially in the most recent articles.
- **Experimentation with Style:** You are trying different hooks, structures, and levels of abstraction.


### **Evidence of Stagnation or Regression**

- **Clarity and Structure:** At times, your writing can be hard to follow due to long sentences, dense paragraphs, or abrupt transitions.
- **Over-Abstractness:** Especially in the second article, you risk losing readers with too much abstraction and not enough grounding.
- **Surface Critique:** Occasionally, critiques lack specific examples or actionable suggestions.

---

## **Actionable Feedback**

1. **Work on Clarity:** Use shorter sentences, clear topic sentences, and explicit transitions.
2. **Balance Abstraction with Example:** When discussing big ideas, always ground them in concrete examples or anecdotes.
3. **Edit Ruthlessly:** After writing, cut unnecessary words and clarify your main points.
4. **Synthesize More:** Try to connect the dots across articles, not just within each one.
5. **Proofread:** Fix minor typos and grammar issues for a more professional finish.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Area | Evidence of Improvement | Evidence of Regression/Needs Work |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Self-awareness | More reflection on learning process | Sometimes over-focus on self, less on reader |
| Analysis | Sharper, more personal critiques | Occasionally lacks concrete examples |
| Structure | Experimenting with hooks and themes | Dense paragraphs, abrupt transitions |
| Clarity | Developing voice, more direct critique | Long sentences, some vagueness |
| Synthesis | Attempts at big-picture thinking | Could connect articles/themes more |


---

**Verdict:**
You are definitely improving as a writer—your voice, analysis, and willingness to experiment are all strengths. Focus on clarity, structure, and balancing abstraction with concrete detail to continue your upward trajectory!

If you’d like, I can show you a revised paragraph or two from your work as an example of how to tighten and clarify your writing. Just ask!
