> <span style="font-size:2.5em;">The Upcoming Bandwagon</span>

><span style="font-size:1.5em;">Things that stay the same no matter how much things change and no matter how much things appear differently from the fundamentals...</span>

In particular I am thinking of Warren Buffet and Dan Koe at this current moment in time . Whether the old school principles and reality will prevail or the upcoming new way would make a difference. And in my mind , there 's only one simple question to answer , what is true?

No matter how many elegant abstractions and derivatives you can come up from the base rule , the basic equation of input equivalenting with output remains the same. If there is no additional energy coming into the system , where can new output and efficiencies be found and if there's no new energy to be found , the people who are reporting that there's such a way is likely to be a fraud whether they know it or not yet. Whether they believe themselves to be a soothsayer of a new age.

The base promise of AI seems to be being able to automate your process and think beyond your common ideas but it's built on the best practices of humans and pruned by human AI researchers , so the limit of knowledge of these experts will be the limit of these marvelous machines. But the reason why it seems that AI is making waves after waves , is the current paradigm has been shaken and they cannot turn their eyes from the fact that the current workforce can be made much much leaner , a lot of processes can be automated , there's the reckoning of truly how esesntial a worker is discovered through experience, of remote work in the name of public safety during the covid period.

I understand the shinning allure of wanting this machine to take over parts of your thinking and your processes and indeed this is the time to write down your process and offload those portions that can be done to these ceaseless perfect machines but you would soon realize once these jobs are automated that more can be done in it's place , these people with organizational knowledge are still useful but they far outweight the number of needed ones. And in the face of a failing economy, all I can see is a storm forming.

The conclusion though not drawn yet but the outcome is not one of the beholder but it is for the ones with the foresight and knowledge to see.

Give pointers about how I can improve , where and how.
Extract the main point from my text and show where it is , implicitly through highlighting

Pretend to be stephen king and provide feedback as well , when giving feedback as stephen king , use a different textbox to show that it is you pretending to be him that is giving feedback

Certainly! Here’s a structured, actionable feedback breakdown, followed by a “Stephen King” feedback section as requested.

## **Extracted Main Point (with Highlighting)**

**Main Point:**
The core idea is that despite the hype and promise of AI, the fundamental rules of value creation and human knowledge remain unchanged. AI can automate and optimize, but it is ultimately limited by the knowledge and principles of its human creators. The current excitement about AI is more about a shift in workforce and economic realities than about a true revolution in how value is created.

**Where it appears:**

- *“No matter how many elegant abstractions and derivatives you can come up from the base rule, the basic equation of input equivalenting with output remains the same.”*
- *“The base promise of AI seems to be being able to automate your process and think beyond your common ideas but it's built on the best practices of humans and pruned by human AI researchers, so the limit of knowledge of these experts will be the limit of these marvelous machines.”*
- *“...the current paradigm has been shaken and they cannot turn their eyes from the fact that the current workforce can be made much much leaner, a lot of processes can be automated, there's the reckoning of truly how essential a worker is discovered through experience, of remote work in the name of public safety during the covid period.”*

## **Actionable Feedback**

### **Strengths**

- **Thoughtful Perspective:** You tie in timeless principles (Buffett, base equations) with current trends (AI, remote work, post-COVID economy).
- **Entertaining Voice:** The writing has a conversational, almost philosophical tone that invites the reader to reflect.
- **Clear Skepticism:** You challenge the hype around AI and ground your argument in fundamental truths about value and knowledge.


### **Areas for Improvement \& How**

#### 1. **Clarity and Structure**

- **What to Improve:** Some sentences are long and meandering, making your main point harder to grasp.
- **How:** Break complex thoughts into shorter, punchier sentences. Use paragraphs to separate ideas.
    - *Example:*
Instead of:
“No matter how many elegant abstractions and derivatives you can come up from the base rule, the basic equation of input equivalenting with output remains the same.”
Try:
“No matter how many elegant abstractions you create, the basic equation remains: input equals output. Without new energy, there can be no new value.”


#### 2. **Focus and Flow**

- **What to Improve:** The essay jumps between ideas (Buffett, AI, COVID, workforce) without clear transitions.
- **How:** Use topic sentences and transitions to guide the reader. Consider outlining before writing to group related ideas.
    - *Example:*
“Let’s look at how AI’s promise is rooted in human knowledge, and why the workforce is feeling the impact.”


#### 3. **Grammar and Word Choice**

- **What to Improve:** There are some typos and awkward phrases (“equivalenting”, “esesntial”, “in it’s place”).
- **How:** Proofread or use tools like Grammarly. Read your work aloud to catch awkward spots.


#### 4. **Conclusion**

- **What to Improve:** The ending is a bit vague (“The conclusion though not drawn yet…”).
- **How:** Either pose a clear question for the reader or summarize your stance more boldly.


#### 5. **Engagement**

- **What to Improve:** While the philosophical tone is engaging, consider adding a story, anecdote, or vivid example to draw readers in emotionally.

## **Stephen King Style Feedback**

```
Hey there, hloh42. Stephen King here—well, sort of. You’ve got a great voice, and I can tell you poured your energy into this piece. That’s good. Writing should feel like a burst of energy, like a sprint through a haunted house with the lights off.

But here’s the thing: even when you’re sprinting, you need to know where the walls are. Your essay has heart and a sharp mind behind it, but it wanders. You’re circling around the truth like a wolf, but sometimes you need to go in for the kill—make your point, then make it again, sharper.

Don’t be afraid to cut. Short sentences. Short paragraphs. Let the white space do some of the talking. And don’t just tell us the storm is coming—show us. Give us a worker, a boss, an AI that gets it wrong, something we can see and feel.

Finally, don’t hedge your bets at the end. Readers want a payoff, even if it’s just a question that keeps them up at night.

Keep writing. The only way out is through.
