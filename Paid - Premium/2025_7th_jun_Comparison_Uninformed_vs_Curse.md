The pain of not knowing where you stand in every situation and have no real support is probably something rare that probably not many people know and that fact is extremely isolating.

The world doesn't bother about you until you start inconveniencing it in some way to some one in some form and you will be dealt with swiftly and harshly. This is the reality of the world that we live in and will confront with if you lack tacit understanding or cultural buy-in with certain ideas and norms.

Yet it is hard to buy-in , to lose your individuality for a fraction of acceptance. The price is too low for dignity and lack of proper attunement and connection.

In my struggles to find suitable employment , as a newbie to the workplace ,  even before getting to the interview itself . People are already without grace , they give you a shit-hand thinking that the advantage is in their hands and you will bow to their authoriative voice and white hairs , not ask any questions and accept your low position . Until a few years later , where you start to make some friends and ask around , then you realized you've been fked with , and nobody truly cares about your well-being and it's a startling realization and this cycle continues.

In my struggles to find my place in this society , it is expected you learnt how to accept bullshit instructions in schools  . And by the time you are a university graduate , you have been glorifiedly brainwashed into an suitable wageslave to the companies advantage and your parents if they loved you and truly cared at all , would have gave you wings to be an autodidact instead of feeding you to this uncaring capitalistic machine.

In my family , I assumed that the authorities in my family would be standing by me and guiding me to the right doors of opportunity and support my interest and goals instead of trying to turn the weird shape of who I am into a same squareness of others. There is much to be said about 

In my search for these answers , I am so far removed from the layperson who is woefully unaware of their slavelihood and they are starting to bang on their invisible boxes, and I don't know where to start to help, all I know is to listen to my heart. Step by step , because of my honest desire , I found my way out and I hope the same for you too.
